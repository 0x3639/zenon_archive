Here are the commands to install it:\nsudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https curl\ncurl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg\ncurl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install caddy\n\n[](#step-2-locate-and-edit-the-caddyfile-3)Step 2: Locate and Edit the Caddyfile\nCaddy’s main configuration file is called the Caddyfile. By default, this file is located at /etc/caddy/Caddyfile. To edit this file, you can use the nano text editor.\n\n\nOpen the Caddyfile in Nano:\nsudo nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile\n\n\n\nAdd Your Configuration:\nHere’s a sample configuration you can add to the Caddyfile:\nexample.com { \n    @websocket {\n        header Upgrade websocket\n    }\n\n    # Handle WebSocket connections and proxy them to the appropriate service\n    reverse_proxy @websocket 127.0.0.1:35998 {\n        header_up Host {http.reverse_proxy.upstream.hostport}\n    }\n\n    # Handle all other HTTP requests and proxy them to the primary web service\n    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:35997 {\n        header_up Host {http.reverse_proxy.upstream.hostport}\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to change example.com to your domain name.\n\n\n\nSave and Exit Nano:\nAfter adding your configuration, save the file by pressing Ctrl + O, then press Enter to confirm. Exit nano by pressing Ctrl + X.\n\n\n[](#step-3-set-up-ufw-firewall-4)Step 3: Set Up UFW Firewall\nTo secure your server, it’s crucial to configure UFW to allow only necessary traffic. Here’s how to do it:\n\n\nEnable UFW and Allow SSH (Port 22):\nsudo ufw allow 22/tcp\n\nThis ensures you can still access your server via SSH.\n\n\nAllow TCP and UDP Traffic on Port 35995:\nsudo ufw allow 35995/tcp\nsudo ufw allow 35995/udp\n\nThis is for allowing traffic to the specific service on this port.\n\n\nEnable UFW:\nsudo ufw enable\n\n\n\nVerify UFW Status:\nsudo ufw status\n\nYou should see that only ports 22, 35995 (TCP and UDP), and potentially other ports you explicitly opened, are allowed. All other inbound traffic will be blocked.\n\n\n[](#step-4-install-and-configure-fail2ban-5)Step 4: Install and Configure Fail2ban\nFail2ban is a service that monitors your server logs for suspicious activity, such as repeated failed login attempts, and bans the offending IP addresses. Here’s how to set it up:\n\n\nInstall Fail2ban:\nsudo apt install fail2ban\n\n\n\nCreate a Local Configuration:\nCopy the default configuration file to create a local override:\nsudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local\n\n\n\nConfigure SSH Protection:\nOpen the jail.local file in a text editor:\nsudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local\n\nLocate the [sshd] section and ensure it’s enabled:\n[sshd]\nenabled = true\nport = 22\nfilter = sshd\nlogpath = /var/log/auth.log\nmaxretry = 5\nbantime = 10m\nfindtime = 10m\n\nThis configuration will ban an IP address for 10 minutes if it fails to log in 5 times within 10 minutes.\n\n\nStart and Enable Fail2ban:\nsudo systemctl start fail2ban\nsudo systemctl enable fail2ban\n\n\n\nCheck Fail2ban Status:\nYou can check the status of Fail2ban and see which IPs have been banned using:\nsudo fail2ban-client status sshd\n\nThis will show you the status of the SSH jail and any banned IPs.\n\n\n[](#step-5-restart-caddy-and-apply-changes-6)Step 5: Restart Caddy and Apply Changes\nAfter configuring the Caddyfile and setting up your firewall and Fail2ban, restart Caddy to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart caddy\n\n[](#final-notes-7)Final Notes\nWith this setup, Caddy handles SSL termination and proxies requests to your backend services, UFW ensures that your server is protected by only allowing essential traffic, and Fail2ban provides an additional layer of security by blocking suspicious activity. This configuration is ideal for running web services securely and efficiently on a single server.\nFeel free to ask any questions or share your experiences with this setup!\n\nThis post now includes instructions on how to locate and edit the Caddyfile using nano, making it more accessible for users who might not be familiar with where the Caddyfile is located or how to edit it.",

        "username": "vilkris",
        "text": "There has been a lot of discussion surrounding dynamic plasma lately, and different ideas have been presented by community members. I’ve spent some time researching the topic and I’ve attempted to combine some ideas in this post and present some ideas for a dynamic plasma implementation.\nI didn’t post this in the dynamic plasma thread, since I wanted to create a thread that focuses mainly on the pros/cons of the ideas presented in this post.\n[](#background-1)Background\n[](#why-do-we-need-dynamic-plasma-2)Why do we need dynamic plasma\nCurrently our network has a hardcoded throughput limit of 100 account blocks per momentum. For an account block to be eligible for inclusion in a momentum, the account block has to have a minimum amount of plasma committed to it. This minimum amount of plasma needed is dependent on the type of the transaction. For example, calling an embedded contract requires a higher plasma commitment than a normal send transaction.\nSince our network utilization rate is so low right now, this mechanism works without issues. There is always space in the momentum so users do not need to compete for their account block to get included in the next momentum.\nOnce the network utilization rate picks up, we will start running into problems. Since a momentum can fit a finite number of account blocks, there has to be a mechanism that allows users to compete for inclusion in a momentum.\n[](#what-is-plasma-3)What is plasma\nThe founding team [introduced](https://medium.com/@zenon.network/plasma-the-new-fee-paradigm-for-the-next-gen-decentralized-network-4ec3f27e4a6b) plasma as “an anti-spam mechanism that acts as the network gas” and “as a third dimension asset similar to the mana concept employed by many popular games”.\nBased on this and based on the current implementation of plasma, we can come to the conclusion that plasma has three purposes: mitigating spam, representing a computational cost for transactions, and allowing for transactions to be prioritized (competing for inclusion in a momentum).\nThe current implementation only fulfills one of these purposes: representing a computational cost associated with a transaction. The anti-spam properties of the current implementation are relatively weak and there is no mechanism that allows for users to compete for inclusion in a momentum.\n[](#plasma-as-a-representation-of-computational-resources-4)Plasma as a representation of computational resources\nUsing “gas” to represent computational resources is a widely utilized concept in other blockchains such as Ethereum. Ethereum transactions require the user to commit a minimum amount of gas to the transaction in order for it to be eligible for inclusion in the next block. The minimum computational cost for a regular ETH transaction is 21,000 gas units. This amount of gas has to be committed to every transaction. The gas is paid for in ETH and the protocol burns this gas when the transaction is processed. This is only a theoretical minimum fee, since in practice the total fee for a transaction is more than this and fluctuates based on network usage.\nThe reasoning for why the requirement is 21,000 gas units can be found [here](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/some-medium-term-dust-cleanup-ideas/6287). Based on Vitalik’s explanation we can see that the gas units required for a transaction are based on the actual computational resources that are needed to process the transaction.\nIn our network a regular transaction also has a computational cost of 21,000 gas units, or rather, plasma. Whether these computational requirements are based on actual testing and benchmarking or just on guesstimation is unknown. The computational cost differs depending on the transaction’s complexity. For example, calling an embedded contract to collect rewards has a computational cost of 73,500 plasma since it requires more computational resources to process the transaction.\nThe maximum account blocks allowed in a momentum is currently 100 and the amount of plasma the most expensive transaction requires is 105,000 (registering a pillar). Based on this we can calculate that the theoretical maximum computational units our network will currently process is 10,500,000 units per momentum.\n[](#plasma-as-a-transaction-prioritization-mechanism-5)Plasma as a transaction prioritization mechanism\nAs stated before, our network doesn’t have any transaction prioritization mechanism currently, but plasma can be used for this purpose, with the basic idea being that committing more plasma to the transaction means higher prioritization of the transaction.\n[](#plasma-as-an-anti-spam-mechanism-6)Plasma as an anti-spam mechanism\nThe third purpose of plasma is to work as an anti-spam mechanism. To me, on-chain spam can be defined as any activity that floods the chain with transactions with the intention to significantly limit the ability of others to use the network. There can be many reasons for conducting a spam attack - for financial gain, for example.\nThe most common anti-spam mechanism used by networks is to require a transaction’s sender to pay a fee. The idea being that the cost of fees will be greater than the potential gain from an attack.\nI think that the anti-spam properties of our current plasma implementation are limited, mainly because the rate at which plasma is currently “recharged”. It’s too fast to effectively throttle an account’s ability to send transactions.\n[](#ideas-for-an-initial-dynamic-plasma-implementation-7)Ideas for an initial dynamic plasma implementation\nBelow are some ideas for how to fulfill the goals presented above. Example implementations and pseudo-code examples of  the following algorithms can be found [here](https://github.com/vilkris4/dynamic-plasma-ideas).\n[](#goal-1-computational-resources-8)Goal 1: Computational resources\nThis goal is already partially met in the current plasma implementation. But since we have finite momentum space, we need to increase the cost of computational resources when demand increases.\nTo meet the goal, we could utilize a dynamic algorithm that adjusts the “price” of computational resources based on network utilization which is readjusted on every momentum.\nThe basic idea being that the readjustment algorithm targets half full momentums. This means that if the previous momentum was more than half full, the price of plasma increases. If the previous momentum was less than half full, the price of plasma decreases. If the momentum was exactly half full, then the price stays the same. For a transaction to be eligible for inclusion in the next momentum, the account block has to commit at least the base plasma requirement for the transaction multiplied by the minimum price of plasma, the “base price”.\nInstead of the current per momentum transaction cap, we would have a per momentum base plasma cap, since different transactions require a different amount of base plasma as explained before.\nThe price of plasma will increase exponentially if there are momentums that are over half full consecutively, meaning that it is economically unviable for momentum size to stay high indefinitely.\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nMomentum Height\nMomentum Fullness\nBase Price\nPrice Change\n\n\n\n\n1\n50%\n1000\n0%\n\n\n2\n100%\n1000\n0%\n\n\n3\n100%\n1125\n12.5%\n\n\n4\n100%\n1265\n12.5%\n\n\n5\n100%\n1423\n12.5%\n\n\n6\n100%\n1600\n12.5%\n\n\n7\n100%\n1800\n12.5%\n\n\n8\n100%\n2025\n12.5%\n\n\n\nThe main benefit of targeting half full momentums, instead of full momentums, is that the base price for plasma is adjusted algorithmically, reducing the need for a bidding war among users when there is a short term spike in momentum space demand. It is also easier for wallets to predict the minimum plasma price needed for a transaction.\nThis is similar to how Ethereum’s current fee adjustment algorithm works as described in [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559).\n[](#goal-2-transaction-prioritization-9)Goal 2: Transaction prioritization\nEven with a dynamically adjusting base price for plasma, there still needs to be a way to prioritize transactions in the situation where the momentum cannot fit all the transactions that are eligible. This could be achieved by simply prioritizing account blocks based on the price of plasma used in the account block.\nplasmaPrice = ab.UsedPlasma / ab.BasePlasma\nTo be eligible for inclusion the account block must fulfill: plasmaPrice >= momentum.BasePrice\nThis allows a user to commit more plasma to their transaction than what is needed, in order to have a better chance of being included in the next momentum if the network is congested.\nNote 1: Account blocks sent by embedded contracts have endless plasma and should probably always have the highest priority, so this is something that has to be taken into account when determining the per momentum base plasma cap.\nNote 2: Since we currently have no way of “forcing” pillars to order transactions in a specific order, there is no way to guarantee that pillars prioritize transactions as intended. I think the best that we can do right now, is minimize the incentives for pillars to alter the ordering of transactions.\n[](#goal-3-anti-spam-10)Goal 3: Anti-spam\nThe anti-spam aspect of plasma is probably the trickiest goal to achieve, depending on what the requirements are. The dynamic adjustment algorithm presented in Goal 1 works as an anti-spam mechanism, but it is probably not enough on its own.\n[](#pow-plasma-anti-spam-11)PoW Plasma anti-spam\nCurrently there is a hard coded PoW-to-Plasma conversion rate, meaning that a given amount of PoW will always be converted to a specific amount of plasma. Currently there is also a hard coded limit to how much PoW can be converted to plasma for an account block.\nIf account blocks are prioritized based on plasma, then having a hard coded limit to how much PoW plasma can be generated can make PoW transactions unviable when there’s high demand for momentum space.\nBut if the hard coded cap, for how much PoW plasma can be generated, is removed, then a user with a significant amount of computing power would be able to generate huge amounts of plasma and gain an undue amount of control over total network bandwidth.\nTo mitigate this problem, we could introduce a dynamic PoW-to-Plasma conversion rate (difficulty-per-plasma), that is dependent on network utilization and how much of the total plasma is being generated by PoW.\nIn the example algorithm a difficulty-per-plasma value is readjusted on every momentum. The target PoW plasma rate in a momentum is set to 20% - this means that when the momentum is over or equal to half full, the PoW plasma percent should be 20%. If it’s less than that, the difficulty-per-plasma will decrease, if it’s more than that, the value will increase. If the momentum is less than half full, the PoW plasma target is 100%, meaning that the PoW plasma percent can be 100% of the momentum without penalty.\nThe example algorithm’s output when PoW plasma is 100% of the momentum’s plasma and the momentum is equal to or over half full:\n\n\n\n\nMomentum Height\nMomentum Fullness\nPoW plasma\nDifficulty-per-plasma\nDifficulty-per-plasma change\n\n\n\n\n1\n>=50%\n100%\n1000\n0%\n\n\n2\n>=50%\n100%\n1500\n50%\n\n\n3\n>=50%\n100%\n2250\n50%\n\n\n4\n>=50%\n100%\n3375\n50%\n\n\n5\n>=50%\n100%\n5062\n50%\n\n\n\nThe example algorithm’s output when PoW plasma is 10% of the momentum’s plasma and the momentum is equal to or over half full:\n\n\n\n\nMomentum Height\nMomentum Fullness\nPoW plasma\nDifficulty-per-plasma\nDifficulty-per-plasma change\n\n\n\n\n1\n>=50%\n10%\n1000\n0%\n\n\n2\n>=50%\n10%\n937\n-6.3%\n\n\n3\n>=50%\n10%\n878\n-6.3%\n\n\n4\n>=50%\n10%\n823\n-6.3%\n\n\n5\n>=50%\n10%\n771\n-6.3%\n\n\n\nWith this algorithm, even a user with a significant amount of computing power, would not be able to occupy over 20% of momentum space indefinitely.\n[](#fused-plasma-anti-spam-12)Fused Plasma anti-spam\nCurrently, whenever fused plasma is used to send a transaction, that plasma gets recharged once the transaction is confirmed. This means that, if transactions are prioritized based on plasma, a malicious user with a significant amount of QSR could easily outbid others for inclusion in a momentum.\nThis problem is relevant since we will probably have to continue to have a conservative network max throughput, even with dynamic plasma, at least initially. My view is that we don’t really have any data to justify raising this throughput limit. Raising the throughput limit is generally a centralizing force, so we would need to do benchmarking to find a throughput limit that can be handled by regular consumer hardware. We want users to be able to run their own nodes.\nTo work around this problem, we could introduce a dynamic plasma recharge rate, so that fused plasma gets recharged at a rate that is dynamically adjusted. Instead of only requiring one confirmation to recharge all fused plasma, the plasma would be recharged at a per confirmation recharge rate.\nThis will act as a counter force to the temptation of excessively committing plasma to a transaction. The more plasma committed, the longer it will take to get it recharged, limiting an account’s ability to occupy momentum space and freeing up bandwidth for other users. This recharge rate would be dependent on the current network utilization rate.\nExample of the recharge rate algorithm (recharge rate = QSR/confirmation):\n\n\n\n\nMomentum Height\nMomentum Fullness\nMomentum Recharge Rate\nTarget Recharge Rate\nRecharge Rate Change\n\n\n\n\n1\n0%\n100\n100\n0%\n\n\n2\n100%\n50\n0.01\n-50%\n\n\n3\n100%\n25\n0.01\n-50%\n\n\n4\n100%\n12.5\n0.01\n-50%\n\n\n5\n100%\n6.25\n0.01\n-50%\n\n\n6\n100%\n3.12\n0.01\n-50%\n\n\n7\n100%\n1.56\n0.01\n-50%\n\n\n8\n100%\n0.78\n0.01\n-50%\n\n\n9\n100%\n0.39\n0.01\n-50%\n\n\n10\n100%\n0.2\n0.01\n-50%\n\n\n11\n100%\n0.1\n0.01\n-50%\n\n\n12\n100%\n0.05\n0.01\n-50%\n\n\n13\n100%\n0.02\n0.01\n-50%\n\n\n14\n100%\n0.01\n0.01\n-50%\n\n\n\nAnother example:\n\n\n\n\nMomentum Height\nMomentum Fullness\nMomentum Recharge Rate\nTarget Recharge Rate\nRecharge Rate Change\n\n\n\n\n1\n100%\n0.01\n0.1\n0%\n\n\n2\n50%\n0.02\n1\n100%\n\n\n3\n50%\n0.04\n1\n100%\n\n\n4\n50%\n0.08\n1\n100%\n\n\n5\n50%\n0.16\n1\n100%\n\n\n6\n50%\n0.32\n1\n100%\n\n\n7\n50%\n0.64\n1\n100%\n\n\n8\n50%\n1\n1\n56%\n\n\n\nFrom these examples we can see that every momentum has its own plasma recharge rate depending on how full the momentum is and what the previous momentum’s recharge rate was. The account chains that have an account block included in a given momentum will be subject to the plasma recharge rate of that momentum.\nThis introduces a “real” penalty for using fused plasma, since when there is high demand for momentum space, it will take a long time for plasma to recharge.\nFor example: If account chain A included an account block in momentum 5, and committed 10 QSR as fused plasma to that account block, it would take 63 confirmations (~10 minutes) to fully recharge the fused plasma.\n[Here](https://github.com/vilkris4/dynamic-plasma-ideas/blob/main/available_plasma.js) is a pseudo-code example of how the committed, or “confined” plasma, is calculated so that the current available fused plasma for an account chain can be calculated.\nNote: In order to not overload terms used in the existing go-zenon codebase, I’m using the term “confined” to mean the plasma that is committed to account blocks and that cannot be used until it has been recharged.\n[](#fused-plasma-recharge-rate-considerations-13)Fused plasma recharge rate considerations\nOne downside of this recharge rate idea is that it limits addresses to a low maximum sustained TPS. If the recharge rate is 1 QSR/confirmation, when blocks are at target fullness, then this means that every address is limited to a sustained throughput of ~0.01 TPS (assuming no PoW is used). This is also assuming the plasma base price is only 1.\nFor the vast majority of users this would probably not be an issue, but businesses and more complex use cases may well need a higher sustained TPS.\nTo alleviate this problem, we could also introduce a recharge rate multiplier that would linearly increase the recharge rate of accounts that have more than some threshold amount of QSR fused. This would probably have to be accompanied by some kind of account level limit of how many transactions could be sent within n momentums.\nIf the network max throughput can be increased, then the recharge rates could also be increased.\n[](#attack-scenarios-14)Attack scenarios\nBelow are a few examples of how the proposed ideas for dynamic plasma would help mitigate the effects of spam attacks.\n[](#scenario-1-fused-plasma-spam-15)Scenario 1: Fused Plasma spam\nI simulated the following attack scenario with the example code, where the attacker owns 1M QSR and fuses it as plasma evenly to 20,000 addresses (50 QSR per address). His goal is to block users that have less than 50 QSR fused from using the network.\nAttack result\n------\nAble to block users with less than 50 fused QSR for 29.17 minutes\nAttack can be repeated in 227.27 minutes\n\nFrom the result we can see that users with less than 50 QSR would basically have to wait a maximum of ~30 minutes for their transaction to be included in a momentum. They would also be subject to a very slow plasma recharge rate, unless they wait for network demand to decrease. The attacker could repeat the attack in ~3 hours and 47 minutes.\nThis is of course a highly simplified simulation since there would most likely be users with more than 50 QSR who would still be able to use the network during the attack, which would result in a longer waiting time for someone with only 50 QSR. On the other hand, if the attacker is only using fused QSR, then the PoW difficulty will decrease, making it easier for users to generate plasma via PoW.\n[](#scenario-2-fused-plasma-spam-16)Scenario 2: Fused Plasma spam\nWe can modify the first scenario a bit and say the attacker’s goal is to block users that have less than 1000 QSR fused from using the network.\nAttack result\n------\nAble to block users with less than 1000 fused QSR for 0.67 minutes\nAttack can be repeated in 430.50 minutes\n\nWe can see that in this scenario the attacker would only be able to block users with less than 1000 QSR for ~40 seconds and would have to wait ~7 hours and 10 minutes to repeat the attack.\n[](#scenario-3-pre-computed-pow-attack-17)Scenario 3: Pre-computed PoW attack\nThis needs more consideration, but I’m not sure if the dynamic difficulty adjustment is enough to mitigate this attack vector; someone pre-computing a massive amount of PoW over days, months, years, and then using it spam the network. Should PoW expire?\n[](#what-about-burning-znn-to-generate-plasma-18)What about burning ZNN to generate plasma\nThe adjustment mechanisms presented in this post can be adjusted, so that new ways of generating plasma can be introduced. If it makes sense from a tokenomic, marketing, and technical standpoint.\nHard coded targets for different “plasma resources” can be introduced, or the plasma resources can directly compete with each other and let market forces dictate at what rate different resources are used.\nFor example, we could add novel ways of generating plasma, like burning some amount of Bitcoin would generate some amount of plasma. This may not actually make sense, but the point is we could potentially unlock new use cases like this.\n[](#remarks-19)Remarks\nThis post became longer than I initially intended. It has lots of stuff to consider, so I appreciate anyone taking the time to read through it. Since there are many angles to consider when it comes to a dynamic plasma solution, I may have failed to consider something important, so feedback and critique is welcomed.",

Maybe in the database.\n\n\n\n sol:\n\nI’m unsure if we should implement global (per momentum) recharge rates.\n\n\nIt has tradeoffs, but I think globally rate limiting fused plasma usage is a reasonable way to distribute the limited network bandwidth amongst different addresses.\n\n\n\n sol:\n\nIf we’re considering tracking rates per address, maybe we can only target accounts that are significantly contributing to congestion.\n\n\nI’m not sure how this could be done in a fair manner. A spammer can disguise himself as a “regular user” with endless on-chain identities. Like in the example attack scenario 1, the attacker is using 20,000 addresses, and can send transactions at a very low per-address rate, but at a very high combined rate. Ultimately what the recharge rate does is it attempts to distribute bandwidth to as many addresses as possible when there is high network usage.\n\n\n\n sol:\n\nI expect this to be more complex but it could lead to a better experience for low-frequency, low-fuse addresses.\n\n\nWith the recharge rate, I think the experience would be relatively good for low-frequency addresses in a congested network.

So an initial dynamic plasma solution should take this into account and ideally not introduce new incentives to pillars to alter the ordering.

Or 8?\nIt could easily be higher than 2. The higher the limit/target ratio the greater the fee market efficiency benefits of EIP 1559. It depends on how severe the short term spikes are that we are willing to accept; 2x is fairly conservative. We could even launch EIP 1559 with a limit/target of 2 to start off, and increase it over time as we see the network functioning okay even under short-term spikes.\n\nSo the reasoning Ethereum used 50% is that the higher the target is, the smaller the fee market efficiency benefits are. I am also assuming they concluded that having 50% of momentum space as a buffer zone to handle short term spikes in demand, is sufficient. Of course we don’t have any real data to analyze what the optimal target would be for our network, so 50% is a neutral choice.\n\n\n\n 0x3639:\n\nWe need to consider the possibility that someone will launch a game on NoM and they will need to interact more quickly.

You can get a better sustained TPS but you’ll need to buy more $QSR.

The categorization is consistent for any hash such that the same hash will fall into the same “bucket”. Due to the nature of cryptographic hashes, this distribution should be fairly even, assuming the hashes are uniformly distributed (a fundamental property of cryptographic hash functions).\nNodes already have this information and they need to switch between the appropriate CheckPoWNonce.

        "text": "I’ve spent some more time thinking about the practical feasibility of the ideas presented in the starting post and I’ve also considered some of the questions that were raised in this thread.\nThe formulas related to the dynamic plasma ideas are presented [here](https://github.com/vilkris4/dynamic-plasma-ideas/blob/main/dynamic_plasma_formulas.md). I hope this format makes it easier to understand the underlying principles. I’ll be using the terminology introduced in that document.\n[](#plasma-recharge-rate-over-n-account-blocks-1)Plasma recharge rate over N account blocks\nIn order to prevent the situation where an account can claim a more optimal recharge rate by submitting a new account block when the network decongests, I’ve modified the recharge rate algorithm slightly from the initial version.\nThe modified idea is that a confirmation target is calculated once an account block is included in a momentum. The confirmation target is the amount of confirmations the frontier account block needs in order to recharge all of the account’s confined plasma.\nConfined plasma is the plasma that is “locked” in account blocks and it has to get recharged before it can be used again.\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nMomentum Height\nBlock Height\nBlock Fused Plasma\nConfined Plasma\nRecharge Rate (plasma/confirmation)\nConfirmation Target\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n21000\n21000\n21\n1000\n\n\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n2\n21000\n39900\n2100\n900+10=910\n\n\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1010\n3\n21000\n21000\n2100\n10\n\n\n\nIn the second account block, we can see that 100 confirmations have elapsed since the first block was included in a momentum. These confirmations are subtracted from the new confirmation target and the second account block’s confirmation target is added to the new confirmation target. This ensures that the user has to wait for all of the confirmation targets from previous account blocks to be surpassed in order to recharge all of the plasma.\nThis also means that every account has its own per confirmation recharge rate that depends on three things:\n\n\nWhat the network’s base recharge rate was when an account block was included in a momentum.\n\n\nWhat the previous account block’s confirmation target and confined plasma amount was.\n\n\nHow much total fused plasma the account has.\n\n\n[](#sustained-tps-of-an-account-2)Sustained TPS of an account\nIn order to allow accounts to have a higher sustained TPS than what the network’s base recharge rate would allow, we could use a recharge rate multiplier that depends on the total fused plasma of an account. The more fused plasma an account has, the bigger the recharge rate multiplier.\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nAccount\nQSR Fused as Plasma\nCurrent Base Recharge Rate\nMultiplier\nAccount Recharge Rate\n\n\n\n\n1\n50\n2100\n0.5x\n1050\n\n\n2\n100\n2100\n1x\n2100\n\n\n3\n8000\n2100\n80x\n168000\n\n\n\nFrom this we can calculate that for an address with 10,000 QSR fused as plasma, the sustained TPS for the account would be 1 TPS, when the base recharge rate is 2,100 (meaning that the momentum is exactly half full). If momentum space demand increases they will not be able to sustain that TPS unless they fuse more plasma, but if our total network max TPS is only 10-20 TPS, then I think these are reasonable numbers. For comparison, it would be very expensive for a user to sustain 1 TPS on other networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have similar throughput capabilities as our network.\nFrom the example above we can also calculate that the absolute maximum amount of confirmations an address needs to recharge all of its fused plasma is 10,000 confirmations (=27.78 hours), regardless of how much fused plasma the account has. This should be acceptable from a UX point of view.\n[](#transactions-per-period-3)Transactions per period\nI initially thought we would need a transactions-per-address-per-period cap, but I don’t think this is needed anymore, since the recharge rate will effectively rate control an account in a similar manner.\n[](#implementation-complexity-introduced-by-the-dynamic-plasma-recharge-rate-4)Implementation complexity introduced by the dynamic plasma recharge rate\nAfter looking at how to actually implement the dynamic recharge rate, I’ve come to the conclusion that it would need two new database indexes: one for the confirmation target and one for the confined plasma amount.\nThese values are computed and stored when the transaction gets included in a momentum. The values are stored in the momentum store. The computations are simple and should have a negligible effect overall. The database has to be read 4 times and written to 2 times. For reference, currently when an account block is stored into the momentum store, it takes 5-7 reads and 3-4 writes (depending on the transaction’s type).\nWhen querying an account’s available fused plasma, it requires 8 database reads. In the current implementation this operation requires 3 database reads.\nLooking at some (old) [benchmarks](https://github.com/google/leveldb#performance) for LevelDB, it does not seem like the plasma recharge rate would be a bottleneck, even with a significantly higher amount of network throughput.\nI’m open to suggestions if someone has a better understanding or ideas for how to determine “how much additional complexity is too much”.\n[](#rbf-5)RBF\nI think the already existing RBF implementation is good enough. A transaction that is in the mempool can be replaced by committing a greater amount of plasma to it. We will need to think about client support for this once network utilization starts picking up.\n[](#full-vs-half-full-momentums-6)Full vs. half-full momentums\nIn the initial post I presented the idea for using half-full momentums, mainly as a way to improve end-user UX by making the estimation of transaction plasma requirements easier. I think most of the reasoning Ethereum has stated for using half-full blocks applies to our network as well.\nIf we were to use full blocks (like on Bitcoin for example), this would mean that we would not have an algorithmically adjusted base price for plasma (as presented in the first post), but transactions would be included in momentums purely based on the plasma price used for the transaction and the estimation for what is a sufficient plasma price for a transaction would have to be done off chain, leading to additional complexity in clients.\nUsing full momentums would also mean that the base recharge rate for fused plasma would have to be calculated in a different way. For example, the base recharge rate could still be based on how full the previous momentum was. But this might lead to very slow overall recharge rates once momentum space is in high demand and when most, if not all, momentums are full.",

        "username": "MoonBaze",
        "text": "To delve right into the topic, merge mining is the concept of mining 2 different chains at once, without splitting the processing power, while only looking for one nonce because the block templates are the same. The only difference is the difficulty. The main blockchain, in our case Bitcoin, will have the main net difficulty and the other chain (share chain) that will be implemented into an embedded will have a lower difficulty. Once in a while, when a miner finds a good nonce ( solution / share ) for the share chain, the resulting hash will also be good for the Bitcoin main net, that block will be broadcasted and accepted by the network. And so, we mined 2 blocks for 2 networks in the same time.\nHow can this concept be implemented on Zenon Network?\nWe will need 3 main components: Embedded Contract, Miners, Hauler ( Proxy between them )\n\nEmbedded Contract with the following roles:\n\n\nMaintain a list of Bitcoin block headers.\nThis is needed so that the hauler can use this as source of reference when creating the block template.\nCreating a block template requires the following fields:\n\n\nversion - This 4-byte little endian field indicates the version of the Bitcoin protocol under which the node is publishing the block.\nhashPrevBlock - This 32-byte little endian field is the double SHA256 hash of the previous block header. This forms the edge of the previous block that joins it to the blockchain DAG.\nhashMerkleRoot - This 32-byte little endian field represents the Merkle root of the Merkle tree that contains the transactions which are timestamped in the block.\ntime - This 4-byte field is the Unix epoch timestamp that is applied to all transactions in the block. Current network policy only requires this value to be accurate within 2 hours of the validating nodes’ local timestamp. The timestamp has 1-second precision.\nbits - This 4-byte field yields the difficulty target value of the proof-of-work) puzzle, as determined by the network rules.\nnonce - This stands for ‘number used once’. The values of this 4-byte field are cycled through to modulate the block header. The hash of the header is then checked against the difficulty target. Nodes provide adequate information such that when all 4.3 billion values of a nonce have been tried, they can modulate the input field in the block’s coinbase transaction and recalculate the Merkle root. This changes the serialized string of the block header, giving another 4.3 billion unique nonce values to iterate in their search for a hash puzzle solution under the difficulty target.\nKnowing this, the constant values will be version, hashPrevBlock, bits, time and can be fetched from the embedded. The variable ones are nonce ( which will be submitted when providing the share) and the merkle root hash. Here it is a little bit tricky. This hash can be constructed from the hashes of all the transactions that will be included in the block, in a particular order, including the coinbase one ( in our case it need to have the destination address the TSS address, or whatever we use to hold the coins ). When a miner is submitting a share, we need to prove that the merkle root hash is constructed from a list of transactions that contains the correct coinbase transaction ( that has TSS address as destination ). The only way to prove this is to reconstruct all the hashes that lead to the merkle root. The most trivial way is to send all transactions when sending the share so the embedded can reconstruct and check it. We cannot do that as that would mean each miner would send every few minutes ( 2500 hashes * 32 bytes ). What we could do, as we only care about the coinbase transaction is this: send only the hashes needed (the ones in red squares) to reconstruct the root using only the coinbase transaction ( which must be known by the embedded ) . \n[image1904×805 92.7 KB](//hypercore.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/original/1X/62f0b1d6dbca685fe8513c09af4f35d5614bd7e6.jpeg)\nThis way each share would contain log 2 of n hashes, where n is the number of transactions in a Bitcoin block. log 2 of 4096 is 12. Let’s upper bound this to 13 maybe, we would have 13 * 32 bytes which is a lot less for now. I will think of other ways we could still optimize this in terms of chain space and I also ask you to come with new ideas on how to validate that a share ( constant values + nonce + merkle root) contains the correct coinbase transaction. Also, the randomness space comes from nonce, and the input  field of the coinbase transaction (4 more bytes). So we could accept every coinbase transaction as long as the destination address and amount is correct. Maybe we could have more TSS addresses, so more randomness space for miners and accept any (just an idea).\nHere we also need a mechanism on the correctness of the Bitcoin header blockchain. We could have a committee where every member would send a transaction specifying which one is the next block header ( when a new Bitcoin block is mined ) and the one with a majority is cemented. This leads to space overhead in time. One other option would be to have an algorithm that decides which member should post the next header and if others believe it is wrong or he does not post, they could intervene.\n\n\n\nMaintain a database of each share submitted for the share chain\nWe need to track how many correct shares each miner sent so that we could incentivize them.\n\n\nMaintain a difficulty and block time logic\nThe same mechanism as Bitcoin’s so share chain has a block time of 2-3 minutes. This is just an example, the topic open for debate, higher time means lower space for our chain as less shares would be sent.\n\n\nAlgorithm to pay the miners\n Each miner would be paid based on how many shares he sent in an epoch and the total number of shares from that epoch. They will be paid in ZNN and (why not ?) BTC ( as ZTS or some way, after we actually mine a block, just an idea for now). Here we need to discuss where to get the ZNN from. We could decrease the percentages of rewards from other contracts (Pillars, Sentinels, LP providers)\n\n\nIn the future we could have 2 share chains, one for small miners like CPU and one for ASICs or Graphics Card.\n\n\n\n\nHauler ( I came up with this name as it is a very important component on actual physical mining and it is used to transport almost everything to and from the mine )\nIts role is to gather information about Bitcoin mempool, Embedded latest block header and coinbase transaction template, send jobs to the miner, send shares to the Embedded and broadcast a valid Bitcoin block if found.\n It needs a connection a Zenon node, it needs a connection to a Bitcoin full node so he knows the mempool and can construct a valid mining job (using the transactions) for the miner.\n It needs to handle multiple miners and know how to distribute jobs so that no redundant work is done ( a nonce is not tried twice by two different miners )\n Very important note, every hardware owner should run its own hauler as connecting to any other ones, means that the jobs received could be tampered with and the coinbase transaction would be different. ( You could mine for them actually, even if only a percent of the jobs are tampered )\n\n\nMiner\n Every miner that is compatible with the Stratum protocol can merge mine!   \nIt just needs a connection to a Hauler.\n\n\nThis post shows that implementing merge mining on the Zenon Network is feasible, we still need to discuss the details on the topics that I’ve mentioned. Also, any other ideas, complaints, optimizations about my view are very welcomed! I hope I did not miss any information, but will edit the post if so, and will gladly answer questions.",

You could connect to anyone but the Hauler will be the one that sends the share so connecting your miner to others Hauler means that he could send you modified jobs ( for example find the nonce for this template that contains my coinbase tx not the one from embedded and if you find it you will mine a block for him) or he could send some correct share for the share chain as coming from him instead of you.\nIf you trust the other one you could connect to him sure",

Is the nonce space much larger for BTC? Why is ours limited to 4 bytes?\n\nWe have the same random space as BTC. Randomness comes from nonce ( 4 bytes ) and from merkle root hash, (maybe also from timestamp). We can change the merkle root by changing the coinbase transaction’s input field (4 bytes) or by changing the order of any two transactions, or by adding / removing transactions. Each of these actions result in a different merkle root hash, hence a different block template. There are options, we just need to be efficient.\n\nI assume optimizations around increasing chain weight are because data will live forever in the embedded contract, so in every full node moving forward? Couldn’t we prune historical data after certain intervals?\n\nWe could let’s say keep in storage only the headers of the last 100 blocks but what we cannot delete is when a Hauler sends in an account block the share of the miner that must contain the necessary data to prove that the list of transactions whose merkle root hash is mentioned, contains the correct coinbase transaction ( which as we speak contains the nonce + at most 13 * 32 bytes, for sure other data we will see. For 1000 miners we are speaking about 0,4 MB every 2-3 minutes.\n\nEmbedded/NoM has no connection to a bitcoin full node. Is the idea that “a committee”, say like the orchestrators now, will be running a bitcoin full node and submitting the required data to the embedded node as NoM transactions? Couldn’t this “agreement” be done off-chain?\n\nTheoretically yes, we would have p2p network between haulers, each would send others their shares ( nonce + the 13 hashes) and by some mechanism they could agree on the correct ones and only send some account blocks to specify who mined how many shares. This seems more complex and with other problems that need to be solved like how could you tell a share (basically nonce + merkle root hash) comes from a hauler after he broadcasts it, roles for who can send the account block to account for shares and so on.\n\nHauler is a great name!\n\n",

The Merkle Tree stores a list of elements, and the zkSNARK is used to prove knowledge of a path from a leaf element to the root of the Merkle Tree. By executing the Merkle Proof inside a zkSNARK, the candidate element and the Merkle path can be kept private\".\nBasically, we only need to post the Merkle zk-proof on-chain and verify it.",

You can follow the progress here: [git](https://github.com/MoonBaZZe/go-zenon).\nSo far I have implemented the logic to store a Bitcoin header chain, add / edit share chains with custom difficulties (maybe different reward multiplier based on the difficulty), copied all the security from Bridge with administrator, guardians and the TSS address. Also tests follow the same design as the one from Bridge because they seem very well written and are easy to use.\nMe and [@Shuccck](/u/shuccck) are in contact and we have agreed that he will work on the Stratum server under my guidance.\nI will now work on accepting the shares logic with that ZK circuit and leave the rewards part at the end. I am also thinking to create a custom update for this contract so we update after / before a few momentums of the pillar update because sometimes it is very slow. The rewards will be based on how much PoW each address has brought, per epoch (24h), so far.\nAfter having a stable version of embedded I will also start to work on the Hauler and then just integrate the Stratum server because it will be coded as a github repo in Golang so I can just import it as a module.\nWe must decide on where should the rewards come from? Reduce from other percentage? Mint extra?\nShould we increase the rewards amount as hash rate increases so we continuously stimulate new miners to come? Come with ideas.",

We need more grass roots marketing that does not have specific conversion and monetization hurdles.\nI’ve taken the time to re-read all Zylers posts.  I made a big mistake in voting no on his AZ.  Granted, Zyler did a terrible job in marketing the AZ and/or explaining it.  Maybe he wanted it to fail so he could explain why grass roots marketing is needed.  Either way, his work can lay the foundation to onboard the next wave of aliens.\nSo while his articles today are getting very few views and we have no way to track their conversions, they are foundational work.  They explain the network in every respect.  They tell a story and they must have taken hundreds of hours to write.  No one in this community has done that and it’s valuable work.  I was hoping one day to do it, but Zyler’s work is far superior to anything I could do myself.\nIt’s like paying for concrete foundations in a building.  Putting concrete into the ground sucks.  It’s creates no aesthetic value, but without a foundation you cannot erect a building.  Meaning, we cannot see the value of Zyler’s work today, but it’s foundational work that we hope will pay off in the future.\n\nConclusion: We should be open to compensate community members willing to contribute foundational work that does not create an immediate result today.\n",

        "text": "One major advantage of PTLCs over HTLCs for atomic swaps is that there is no direct on-chain linkage of paired PTLCs. However, as with anything related to privacy, heuristics and correlation of metadata such as timing can link txs with high degree of confidence. The privacy of a single PTLC thus depends on the existence of other PTLCs; the greater the anonymity set the better.\nHere are some ideas, used together, to get full advantage of PTLCs.\n(For the sake of this discussion, we will assume that the increased plasma requirements are not a problem.)\n\n\nExternally, only use standard sends when the desired outcome is a public payment between two known addresses. Internally, only use standard sends for organizing funds between accounts that are already correlated.\n\n\nIf seeking to create a new on-chain identity, when sending funds to a new address, always use a PTLC. This is only effective when other metadata is not correlated. Need to have wallet features to disable auto-receiving, and to help the user collect rewards at different times. Random pillar delegation selection. With a big enough anonymity set, this is much better than say sending to a Cex and withdrawing.\n\n\nWhen sending funds to other users, send PTLCs to each other. This is similar to Bitcoin’s concept of coinjoins. If you want to send a user 5 ZNN, instead create a PTLC sending them 10 ZNN, and they will create a PTLC sending you 5. These are actually more private than coinjoins because all ptlcs contribute to the anon set of all other ptlcs within a certain timespan.\n\n\nAdd randomness by default to timing parameters to prevent correlation.\n\n\nPrefer disposable BIP340 point types even for ZTS-ZTS swaps, to increase the anonyminity set of cross chain swaps with btc.\n\n\nI might refactor the PTLC embedded to have an account model where PTLCs can be created and unlocked within the embedded contract without needing to withdraw to a zenon address. This can enable high plasma accounts to better take advantage of the proxy unlock feature and greatly increase the number of PTLCs for greater anonymity set.\n\n",

But as I started to understand it better, it wasn’t that easy to implement directly it in CLI.\nPTLCs require much more coordination between both parties, a trusted party is needed to facilitate the communication. To avoid making the entire project too complex, I created a demo instead.\nIt demonstrates a single chain atomic swap using PTLCs on the Zenon Network. The repository has a sequence diagram showing all the steps involved. Following the instructions one can execute it running a local devnet with PTLC support.\nIt’s a first working example written in Go. More research is needed to add other and alternative use cases to the repo. Such as a cross chain atomic swap between znn and btc for example.\nI hope this helps the community understand PTLCs better and that it helps us getting a step closer to successfully implement PTLCs on NoM.\n\n\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/KingGorrin/znn_ptlc_use_cases_go)\n\n\n\n[GitHub - KingGorrin/znn_ptlc_use_cases_go](https://github.com/KingGorrin/znn_ptlc_use_cases_go)\nContribute to KingGorrin/znn_ptlc_use_cases_go development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I think it is better if all related repos reside under the zenon-network org. Together with the sdk and cli.\nThe same counts for the ledger-app-zenon repo. We haven’t received an official review yet from Ledger, but I can imagine they would like some kind of prove it belongs to zenon-network.\nI don’t think it matters much for the developer mode, but eventually I think it should be officially recognised by zenon-network.\nMoving it now only confuses things, so I propose to wait for a reply from Ledger first, before moving the ledger-app-zenon repo.",

        "text": "[](#background-1)Background\nSome time ago I tried to have a discussion with the community about a bridge referral link in the /bridge command in the Main Telegram Channel.  During this time we were discussing ways to increase funding to AZ.  One of those ideas was to reduce pillar rewards and divert them directly to AZ.  Another idea was to generate bridge affiliate fees from Telegram Main and redirect them to AZ.  I proposed that idea [here](https://forum.zenon.org/t/bridge-referral-link-from-tg-main/1701) and linked to it in TG [here](https://t.me/zenonnetwork/332420).\nI explored ways to deposit the bridge affiliate fees directly into AZ, but after discussions with [@sol](/u/sol) we determined that was not possible. So my proposal was to receive the fees into the address z1qz78vztx78hzpyzhfe0hk0mndszrf344na3zlr and then manually deposit them into AZ.  To date, that address has received ZERO $znn.  It’s possible there are some unreceived fees.  To be honest, I have never checked.  But no matter what, they are due to the community as discussed in that post.\nI never got any feedback (for or against) so I implemented the bridge affiliate link as proposed.\nWhen you type /bridge in TG you see this Website for the bridge.\n[Screenshot 2024-02-27 at 8.31.11 PM754×306 20.8 KB](//hypercore.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/original/1X/766c446129e57bae78046abab86d9fa49aa8440d.png)\nThat URL points to this short link https://znn.link/bridgezts so we can track the number of clicks.

What’s the point to give such tools to the community if core routes like TG main have a default referral built-in? Might as well put the default on zenon.network and Zenon_Network twitter handle and give all the future rewards to AZ. Even the bridge itself asks for users to find their own referral links, passing the opportunity onto the community to earn some rewards.\nLet’s leave core routes alone from rewards which could undercut efforts of community to earn. And especially if it has to be deposited to a community member’s address first.\n\n\n\n 0x3639:\n\nIf we decide to remove the bridge affiliate link from the TG channel it’s likely someone else will collect the fees: Funnelz, Nodez, Front end affiliate logic as disclosed by [@sumamu](/u/sumamu), other affiliates, etc.\n\n\nAs intended by design, why block organic efforts? Anyone sharing an Attribute link / referral link should be granted that reward if he’s first to help someone, effort well deserved no?\nMy bigger question is: why was this opportunity diverted from community earning rewards, to AZ? And why are network-owned channels like TG main not governed by Pillars via on-chain voting?",

As evidenced by Dexterz’s latest bridge version, improvements have been made in this area by moving the notification to a more prominent position.\n\n\nIt was highlighted that there was a need to find a referral link, and a debate ensued regarding this being a poor user experience due to users missing out on rewards.\n\n\nAs a “TEMPORARY” solution, we agreed to add a referral link to the TG notification to mitigate the issue in the meantime. As more people create content and the issue becomes less significant, this referral link will become unnecessary for the reasons you’ve mentioned: by design, referral rewards should reward organic efforts.\n\n\nIf we believe the community has already made significant improvements, and we anticipate a decrease in the percentage of users bridging without a referral code, we should consider removing the affiliate link from TG.\nPersonally, I would prefer to wait until the new bridge front-end, currently in the staging phase, is live.",

The NoM Multichain Technology can become a de-facto hub for interoperability within the ecosystem.\nThis way, the base layer remains minimal & efficient as Mr Kaine emphasizes and all the heavy work/bloat is kept in a separate execution domain.\nPillars produce inflation as ZNN and they will also run the orchestrator nodes. It makes sense for them to also act as validators for a L2/sidechain where fees are paid in ZNN. The L2/sidechain should not produce additional/separate inflation. Pillars can bridge part of their ZNN inflation into the L2/sidechain ecosystem and they will be incentivized to bridge more if usage is high.\nZNN is not a gas token because the L2/sidechain will use a wrapped representation of it. It can be called eZNN or xZNN (execution ZNN).\nWe can use the decentralized bridge [@sumamu](/u/sumamu) built and tweak it to support this type of wrapping. It would be a little bit different from wrapping ZNN to wZNN and unwrapping it later because xZNN will actually be consumed/burnt in the extension chain, so it won’t be a 1:1 backing.\nxZNN can be associated with the gas concept for the extension chain.\nSince there won’t be any inflation, the extension chain will only have a fee distribution mechanism:\n\n33% distributed to builders (contract deployers)\n33% distributed to extension chain validators\n34% burned (similar to ETH)\n",

The aim is to provide a new ground for economic experiments in [web3](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/web-3-0), where DeFi builders and [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) creators can collectively benefit from a flourishing blockchain ecosystem.\n\n[\n\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vba3Fdx1960)\n\n",

When a contract is called on the sidechain, (and per the 33%, 33%, 34% distribution above), the builder received 0.33 ZNN, the validators receive 0.33 ZNN, and 0.34 ZNN is burned.  this 1 ZNN will get represented as 1 xZNN on the sidechain and it will be consumed entirely to do the work.

Therefore, they will consume xZNN and it will be redistributed according to the specified percentages directly by the system contract to the contract deployer, burn address and ext-chain validators.\nMore users => more activity => higher gas fees => more xZNN gets consumed => higher payouts for builders and validators and less ZNN in circulation. It’s a win-win-win situation for everybody.\nThe embedded that will convert ZNN to xZNN needs to be carefully designed, because there won’t be a 1:1 backing (we need to take into account xZNN burning).",

Also in order to list a new blockchain it must be approved by their governance system:\n\nThe native coin is listed in the top 100 coins on CoinMarketCap and proposal gets approved on [[https://governance.trustwallet.com](https://governance.trustwallet.com)].\n\nI don’t think we currently have any chance to get native ZNN listed, but we can give it a shot.\n\nList xZNN (Supernova support)\n\nThis is easier to accomplish because we don’t need to reinvent the wheel (Supernova is an EVM chain):\n\n\n\n[developer.trustwallet.com](https://developer.trustwallet.com/developer/wallet-core/newblockchain/newevmchain)\n\n\n\n[New EVM-compatible chain | Trust Developers](https://developer.trustwallet.com/developer/wallet-core/newblockchain/newevmchain)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also need to cover some listing [fees](https://developer.trustwallet.com/developer/listing-new-assets/new-asset#fee) and [meet some requirements](https://developer.trustwallet.com/developer/listing-new-assets/requirements#listing-acceptance-guidelines) for example: “minimum 10,000 token holders and 15,000 transactions”.",

        "username": "vilkris",
        "text": "[](#the-problem-1)The problem\nWhen the node’s account pool if filled with pending blocks, specifically with long individual account chains, the node is incabable of producing new momentums.\nWhen the node attempts to create a new momentum, the node has to fetch all the known pending blocks from the in-memory database which is provided by the LevelDB package. Something in the database’s implementation makes it very slow to fetch a large amount of values in short succession. This slowness ultimately cripples the node.\nBased on my testing it requires only around 500 to 1,000 pending blocks to cripple the node. This allows for a relatively low cost attack vector for a bad actor, requiring only 5,000 to 10,000 QSR fused as plasma to execute an attack that would most likely result in pillars not being able to produce new momentums.\nNot to mention if the network’s utilization rate were to organically increase, this would be a severe issue.\n[](#possible-solution-2)Possible solution\nIn order to quickly fetch all the pending blocks, we could store the blocks in a separate key-value map. While this increases memory usage slightly, it makes fetching the pending blocks extremely fast.\nAn implementation of the solution can be found [here](https://github.com/vilkris4/go-zenon/tree/feature/improve_account_pool_performance).\n[](#comparison-3)Comparison\nWith the current implementation we can see that once there are only a few hundred pending blocks in the account pool, the GetAllUncommittedAccountBlocks() function starts to take a significant time to execute. At 700 blocks, the function becomes so slow that the node is unable to produce new momentums because of timeouts.\nProducing momentum ...\nGetAllUncommittedAccountBlocks duration: 977.1µs - Count: 0\n[Momentum inserted] Height: 2766, Hash: bf903a09bede99c15567513a5c9acea3f3247e8d425f0ede3a58268f9bca74c3, Timestamp: 1716357703, Pillar producer address: z1qzpgy94f9eex2xqacrl3gcjf4adgrmgn09s466, Current time: 2024-05-22 09:01:43, Txs: 0\nProducing momentum ...\nGetAllUncommittedAccountBlocks duration: 347.5673ms - Count: 300\n[Momentum inserted] Height: 2767, Hash: 8bb97ea38683858f3e5678786f1bb85c37dcd22227c595d7e8141f2fac5f5e96, Timestamp: 1716357713, Pillar producer address: z1qzpgy94f9eex2xqacrl3gcjf4adgrmgn09s466, Current time: 2024-05-22 09:01:53, Txs: 100\nProducing momentum ...\nGetAllUncommittedAccountBlocks duration: 1.4542433s - Count: 500\n[Momentum inserted] Height: 2768, Hash: a93ffd920f45ad5133ee98450520f5f09ddcf25545a6cf1c5877149d44d65c4b, Timestamp: 1716357723, Pillar producer address: z1qzpgy94f9eex2xqacrl3gcjf4adgrmgn09s466, Current time: 2024-05-22 09:02:05, Txs: 100\nProducing momentum ...\nGetAllUncommittedAccountBlocks duration: 4.2393541s - Count: 700\nProducing momentum ...\nGetAllUncommittedAccountBlocks duration: 13.2914476s - Count: 1000\nProducing momentum ...\nGetAllUncommittedAccountBlocks duration: 12.8638255s - Count: 1000\nProducing momentum ...\nGetAllUncommittedAccountBlocks duration: 13.1407267s - Count: 1001\nProducing momentum ...\n\nWith the key-value map implementation, the node has no issues producing momentums even when there are thousands of pending blocks.\nProducing momentum ...\nGetAllUncommittedAccountBlocks duration: 10.1331ms - Count: 2600\n[Momentum inserted] Height: 2793, Hash: 84a17e2dcb87d3196d77ad39f1635dfa34b75fa41c585f24f604ba85f83ad548, Timestamp: 1716360953, Pillar producer address: z1qzpgy94f9eex2xqacrl3gcjf4adgrmgn09s466, Current time: 2024-05-22 09:55:53, Txs: 100\nProducing momentum ...\nGetAllUncommittedAccountBlocks duration: 18.0076ms - Count: 3100\n[Momentum inserted] Height: 2794, Hash: f69217a91c3d841c8bd14bf1bc70aaf70c3205a4c2f09bd9e548b7e28a57a02a, Timestamp: 1716360963, Pillar producer address: z1qzpgy94f9eex2xqacrl3gcjf4adgrmgn09s466, Current time: 2024-05-22 09:56:03, Txs: 100\nProducing momentum ...\nGetAllUncommittedAccountBlocks duration: 13.1556ms - Count: 3600\n[Momentum inserted] Height: 2795, Hash: 45d34f8fe9c5b27e91e8fbc27278ef51577f737e1e074aaead104a9935432b8d, Timestamp: 1716360973, Pillar producer address: z1qzpgy94f9eex2xqacrl3gcjf4adgrmgn09s466, Current time: 2024-05-22 09:56:13, Txs: 100\nProducing momentum ...\nGetAllUncommittedAccountBlocks duration: 26.1455ms - Count: 4100\n[Momentum inserted] Height: 2796, Hash: 30358f64633a3ba4d8f61b4022a7de1ab168fecc376829c308de3596dc7d93ef, Timestamp: 1716360983, Pillar producer address: z1qzpgy94f9eex2xqacrl3gcjf4adgrmgn09s466, Current time: 2024-05-22 09:56:23, Txs: 100\nProducing momentum ...\nGetAllUncommittedAccountBlocks duration: 16.3197ms - Count: 4600\n[Momentum inserted] Height: 2797, Hash: 6db6233579608909cf6647bba332500d76743397a0774a1e4f55f5ee77f4d953, Timestamp: 1716360993, Pillar producer address: z1qzpgy94f9eex2xqacrl3gcjf4adgrmgn09s466, Current time: 2024-05-22 09:56:33, Txs: 100\nProducing momentum ...\nGetAllUncommittedAccountBlocks duration: 17.6367ms - Count: 5000\n[Momentum inserted] Height: 2798, Hash: 30ff05bc2ff8a7a710159b37ebead105522593a814f49dfff3b276dfaf7968ec, Timestamp: 1716361003, Pillar producer address: z1qzpgy94f9eex2xqacrl3gcjf4adgrmgn09s466, Current time: 2024-05-22 09:56:43, Txs: 100\n",

        "text": "Concerning the sign transaction design UI flows.\nReceive transactions\nUnlike other cryptocurrencies, Zenon requires unreceived transactions to be signed. The proposal mentioned that the [send flow](https://github.com/KingGorrin/ledger-app-zenon/blob/main/assets/diagrams/app-flow-send.png) is applicable for both transaction types. This is partially true, because unreceived transactions do not contain the same information. Therefore, the UI flow cannot show the amount and the from address. In order to show this information , a separate “from” transaction needs to be supplied.\nThe current implementation accepts one transaction for signing, namely the transaction to be signed. Future versions may extend this for unreceived transactions.\nThis means that the UI flow for signing receive transactions will be different, see below:\nsend tx = blocktype 2 & 4\nreceive tx = blocktype 1, 3 & 5\nA send transaction has the following flow:\n\nReview transaction\nType (display send)\nAmount (display amount and token symbol ZNN, QSR or ZTS)\nAddress (display to zenon address)\nApprove or Refuse\n\nA receive transaction has the following flow:\n\nReview transaction\nType (display receive)\nHash (display tx hash as hexidecimals)\nApprove or Refuse\n\nBlind signing\nThe proposal also mentioned the following about blind signing.\n\nSigning unreceived transactions or interacting with Embedded Smart Contracts will possibly require a [blind signing](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/embedded-app/functional-requirements/) setting.\n\nIt turns out that blind signing is not required for both mentioned types of transactions. However, it can be used to sign unknown data formats. For example, if the ledger app doesn’t recognise the send tx data, it will hash and display it for approval. The option could be useful if you want to sign something other than transactions.\nIn order to use the blind signing option it needs to be implemented and enabled by the user. This option is considered a could have and is not required for the first version.\nUnattended signing\nUnattended signing signs a transaction without any user (display) interaction. This is a bit controversial and while technically possible, I haven’t seen any implementations of it.\nI’m currently considering this option as a won’t.",

Therefore, the current implementation cannot display decimal precision and the token symbol in the case of a ZTS token when signing a transaction.\nInstead, the current implementation shows the amount without decimals and uses the ZTS symbol.\nAs a future enhancement, the app can include a token info command to supplement the token info. In the case of a ZTS token, the client will first provide the app with the token info by sending the token info command and then have the transaction signed.\nThe app checks and uses it if appropriate token information is present or falls back to the current implementation.\nTransaction information command\nLike the token-information command, additional transaction information can be provided in case of signing a receive transaction. The details of the receive transaction can be displayed in the same way as when signing a send transaction.\nThe app checks and uses it if appropriate transaction information is present or falls back on the current implementation (display hash).",

        "username": "vilkris",
        "text": "[](#the-problem-1)The problem\nWhen an account block is verified, the block has to be verified against the state of the ledger as determined by the block’s momentum acknowledged (momAck) property.\nWhile clients will generally use a momAck height close to the frontier, the momAck height can be anything, meaning that the node must be able to access any old state of the ledger quickly in order to keep block verification as fast as possible.\nCurrently the node will rollback the state of the ledger in order to access the state determined by the momAck height. If the momAck references a state far away from the frontier state, it will take the node a long time to rollback the ledger to that state, causing significant perfomance issues on the network.\nMost worryingly, this issue allows for an easy attack vector for bad actors, making it trivial to overstrain nodes and freeze the network.\nThis problem caused the issues we experienced at height 6606105.\n[](#possible-solution-2)Possible solution\nIn order to quickly access any old state of the ledger, we could partition the ledger into snapshots so that old states can be constructed fast.\n[](#example-3)Example\nThe ledger is partitioned into snapshots of 1000 momentums, meaning that the partition with index 0 will store the state changes between height 1 and 999. The partition with index 527 will store the state changes between 527,000 and 527,999.\nThen if we want to access the state at height 4,999,999 for example, we can merge the partitions indexed 0 to 4999 and we will have constructed the full ledger state at height 4,999,999.\nIf we want to access the state at height 5,045,832, we will have to merge the partitions indexed 0 to 5045. This will give us the ledger’s state at height 5,045,999, which is not what we want. To get the correct state, we can use the already existing rollback mechanism to rollback the state of the partition indexed 5045 from height 5,045,999 to 5,045,832. Since we are using the partitions, it is guaranteed that the rollback distance will always be small, resulting in fast rollback times. If the frontier height of the ledger is 7,500,000, then without partitions this would mean that the node would have to rollback almost 2.5 million momentums to access the state at height 5,045,832. With partitions, it will only have to rollback a little over 150 momentums.\nOne problem these partitions introduce is that it is slower to read from the merged partition database. This is because when reading a key from the database, it will have to iterate through every partition to see if it has the queried key.\nIterating through thousands of partitions in this manner is relatively slow. To alleviate this problem, we can introduce different sized partition snapshots.\nFor example, if we have partitions of sizes 1000, 10,000 and 100,000, then accessing height 5,045,832 would result in needing to merge only 60 partitions. This improves read performance significantly.\nThe downside to this is that storing the partitions of three different sizes for the entire ledger requires quite a lot of disk space - around an additional 10 GB. The ledger’s current size is around 6 GB.\nFor the purpose of validating account blocks, most of this data is redundant though. In order to only store the data needed for validating blocks, we can create a separate archive database that stores the data and partitions it. This brings the additional disk space requirement down to around 2 GB.\nTo summarize, using a separate archive database and using partitions allows for good performance and keeps the additional disk space requirements relatively low.\n[](#implementation-4)Implementation\nAn implementation of the solution can be found [here](https://github.com/vilkris4/go-zenon/tree/feature/add_partitioned_archive).\nThis implementation archives and partitions the data that is required for user account block verification. This implementation is able to quickly verify a user account block referencing any momAck height.\nWhen running this implementation for the first time with an already existing database, it will create the separate archive database at startup. This will take some time (30-60 min).\nThe implementation is relatively well tested and will sync from scratch without issue.",

I have admin rights over the org, but not full control.  I cannot add repos and I cannot transfer repos.  Fortunately many community devs have established their own repo and they have built trust over the years.\n@zenon_network on Twitter is controlled by a 3rd party.  I have API access to it but I do not control it.\nHyperCore-Team and HyperCore-One software teams both have repos that focus on Zenon Network\n\nIt appears zenon.network was renewed for a year and the nameserver were removed at the same time.  If  we asume is going away for ever we need to discuss a few things:\nWhat is the new Community presence for Zenon Network?\nThat will need to get updated in syrius and we will need to update the links on twitter, CMC, and CG.  It probably also makes sense to move the /zenon-network repo on Github to the new Community presence.\nI propose zenon.community as the new Zenon Network community presence.\n\nSumamu / Dexter own the domain\nHC1 hosts a public repo that is a fork of zenon.network\nAny community member can see the code and update it\nHopefully over time the community updates and changes the website.  Maybe it become a landing page for links to sites like zenon.info and [zenon.org](http://zenon.org) and others who education on Zenon Network.\n\nI personally believe the new presence should be a Community Presence that has distributed ownership and controls.  Over time, hopefully we won’t have shared ownership in things and Pillars and community members will build their own presence for Zenon Network and maybe the community website vanishes.  That is for the community to decide.\nI do not think the community presence should be [zenon.org](http://zenon.org).  That website is closed source and is the identity of a pillar.  And if the site was open sourced I’m still not a proponent of it becoming the community brand.   In all honesty I think the company and people behind [zenon.org](http://zenon.org) do not represent the community.  My approach in life and business is fundamentally different than how .org operates.",

This results in skipped momentums that lower overall network performance related to transactions per second. I was thinking we could introduce a mechanism where pillars that do not produce any momentum or have a really low ratio of produced / expected momentums in e period of time to become inactive and so skipped from the algorithm which chooses the next pillars to produce in the next 30 momentums. They could reactivate themselves later by calling a method (e.g. Activate) which enables them to be selected to produce again.\nWhat do you think about this? If you agree, what period of time or ratio threshold do you think of?\nWe could even go further with slashing but that’s more complex in terms of logic and implementation but ideas are welcomed.",

What we can do is what [@MoonBaze](/u/moonbaze) is proposing: excluding them from the active validator set. I’ve read the proposal again and that’s why I’ve changed my mind with the monetary punishment.\nWe can add the following condition for the Activate function: only callable once every 3 epochs. This way the Pillar operator will think twice before calling the function because he will miss 2 epochs worth of rewards if he fails to maintain uptime for the Pillar.\nI know you’re trying to get AZ funded, but we need a more sustainable way to do it for the long run.",

        "text": "We’d like the community to help us test this release. We do this through one or more test rounds. For each test round, a release candidate is issued and testing takes place for a period of time. After each round, any errors found are resolved and a new test round will be announced until no more errors are found.\nA number of test cases have been set up to help testers get a grip on what to test. The test cases contain scenarios that try to cover the underlying code changes. The test cases do not cover the code changes 100% and therefore there are situations that are not covered by them.\nThe following tests have been setup:\n\n[auto-receive](https://github.com/zenon-network/syrius/tree/release-0.2.0/tests/auto-receive/)\n[community-nodes](https://github.com/zenon-network/syrius/tree/release-0.2.0/tests/community-nodes)\n[ledger](https://github.com/zenon-network/syrius/tree/release-0.2.0/tests/ledger)\n[walletconnect](https://github.com/zenon-network/syrius/tree/release-0.2.0/tests/walletconnect)\n\nWhen creating a test-run, copy a test and fill in the following information:\n\nSyrius version you’re using to the test\nEnvironment\nDate of the test\nName or handle of the tester\n\nThe result of a test case is either PASS or FAIL. Leave it blank if for whatever reason you’re not able to test the case. Submit the results of your test-run on the forum. The test-runs give us a good idea of what has been tested.\nThe reason and details of a FAIL test case must be submitted as an issue on the [Syrius](https://github.com/zenon-network/syrius/issues) repo. See below for more information.\n[](#bug-bounties-1)Bug bounties\nTesters who find bugs are rewarded through the bug bounty program. Anyone can participate, but in order to qualify for a reward, submitted bugs must meet a number of requirements.\n\nBugs must be submitted on GitHub under the [Syrius](https://github.com/zenon-network/syrius/issues) repository as issues\nBugs must have a clear description (a template has been setup to help you fill in the necessary information)\nBugs that cannot be reproduced will be ignored\nThe issue must contain a Zenon address to qualify for a reward\nWhen duplicates occur, we only award the first report that was received (provided that it can be fully reproduced)\n\nBugs will be divided into three categories, namely: Low, Medium, High. All bugs for Syrius fall between 0.1 and 3.9 CVSS and the rewards are set accordingly. The following table shows the rewards per category.\n\n\n\n\nSeverity\nAmount\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nLow\n10 ZNN\nBug won’t result in any noticeable breakdown of the system\n\n\nMedium\n25 ZNN\nResults in some unexpected or undesired behavior, but not enough to disrupt system function\n\n\nHigh\n50 ZNN\nBugs capable of collapsing large parts of the system\n\n\n\nA total amount of 500 ZNN has been allocated for the bug bounty program. No further rewards will be paid once it is depleted. The bug bounty fund will remain untouched when no bugs are found, to be used for future releases.\n[](#testnet-2)Testnet\nDo not test with live funds, but connect Syrius to a testnet using the following node and chain id. Use the faucet to receive the necessary test funds.\nChainID: 3\nNode: wss://syrius-testnet.zenon.community:443\nFaucet: [Telegram: Contact @znn_faucet_bot](https://t.me/znn_faucet_bot)\n[](#test-rounds-3)Test rounds\nWhen testing begins, a round of testing will be announced in a separate post. The post contains instructions for downloading the release candidate and all test-runs are collected in that post until the end of the round.\nThis will be repeated until the release is deemed ready for publication.",

This post will share a quick update.\n[@CryptoFish](/u/cryptofish) and I have been working with [XeggeX](https://xeggex.com/) to develop a wallet API app that CEXs can use to help them manage ZTS assets on their exchange.  We currently have the following endpoints (images).  These include everything that XeggeX has asked for.\nThis walletAPI is designed to be run within the CEX’s private infrastructure.  It should never be exposed to the public.  There is one wallet and each user will have their own accountIndex.  The CEX can use local QSR to fuse to each address OR use the Plasma Bot at [ZenonHub.io](http://ZenonHub.io).  There are basic send and receive functions, fuse / unfuse plasma, and various ledger options.  In addition, the CEX has the ability to add and remove addresses to an auto receive function so the wallet receives TXs automatically.  Finally, there is DOS protection if someone sends many small TXs to a wallet address.\nThe wallet will have a simple User ID and Password to establish a secure connection to the wallet.  This UI could be expanded in the future to setup multiple users with privileges.\nThe goal is to have this wallet ready for production in April.\n[Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 7.05.24 PM2910×998 183 KB](//hypercore.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/original/1X/3dd6655741d52125d623d78af9d22f7bc172d6f6.png)\n[Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 7.05.37 PM2892×878 152 KB](//hypercore.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/original/1X/0bce254294dc59cf5c36884f259ab73447ff3350.png)\n[Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 7.05.45 PM2892×754 129 KB](//hypercore.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/original/1X/b408bc369a5d3ca3c021cf87c6cd74e3e905a648.png)",

        "text": "Over the past few days some community members have been engaged in a discussion about how Bitcoin and NoM will interact. Can the community reverse engineer a potential design that is directionally accurate? This post will explore that topic.\nBut before we get started, let’s review some background before diving in.\n[](#background-1)Background\n\nMarch 2019: Zenon Network was launch with xStakes, an innovative funding mechanism that required a Bitcoin deposit.  Early investors speculated [xStakes included a novel “smart contract”](https://medium.com/@shaimo/the-zenon-enigma-782f8b293bd6) between Bitcoin and NoM.\nNovember 12, 2021: [@georgezgeorgez](/u/georgezgeorgez) wrote an article explaining the [limitations of Lightning Network](https://medium.com/@georgezgeorgez/a-message-to-humans-an-aliens-guide-to-lightning-network-watchtower-limitations-and-beyond-96138967fa9b) and proposed a new design that could overcome the shortcomings.\nNovember 15, 2021: Taproot was activated and @zenon_network tweeted [“Never doubt you can make history. You already have”](https://twitter.com/Zenon_Network/status/1460240120309760010?t=k58m11sk6kqykJKh1dbaLQ)\nMarch 22, 2023: Mr. Kaine told George to [check out xClaim:](https://t.me/zenonnetwork/274875).  Here is the [xClaim whitepaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/643.pdf).\nDec 2023: [@Nostromo](/u/nostromo) started to question the [purpose of Sentinels and Sentries](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/network-of-momentum-phase-1/253/11) after several posts by [@aliencoder](/u/aliencoder) about the potential use of Sentinels and Public Nodes.\nMarch 2024: Quantum PP in Telegram started to ask [questions about Sentinels](https://t.me/zenonnetwork/354359) and discuss how NoM might interact with the Bitcoin Network. qPP also pointed out three interesting graphics in the [Zenon Network marketing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqAequz4mgk) and in the [Zenon.network](https://zenon.network) website. The first image appears to be a black hole sucking in Bitcoin.  The second image references a cross-chain presence with Orbital Liquidity Staking.  And the third image highlights the goal to interoperate with Bitcoin while tapping into its security and decentralization.\n[Screenshot 2024-03-16 at 5.45.14 PM1920×871 69.2 KB](//hypercore.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/original/1X/3d78a847e3aee614ea276a8ecbcf1637facd2835.jpeg)\n[Screenshot 2024-03-16 at 5.44.22 PM1002×1314 72.8 KB](//hypercore.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/original/1X/b3bae54849d515c94f1171f1c2ec60025e8e1bd9.jpeg)\n[Screenshot 2024-03-16 at 5.56.28 PM2750×1170 234 KB](//hypercore.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/original/1X/991e12d7ad49b8fe41b767e53febbdcddcc7f803.jpeg)\n\n[](#chatgpt-bitcoin-interoperability-network-design-2)ChatGPT Bitcoin Interoperability Network Design\nWARNING:  This design is speculation and not endorsed by any developer.  These are notes and ideas for further discussion and criticism.  These ideas were developed by chatGPT and directed with training data from xClaim, Zenon Network, Lightning Network, Schnorr Multi-Signatures, Taproot and community ideas from Telegram.\n\nDesigning a system that leverages Bitcoin’s Taproot, xClaim, and Schnorr Multi-Signatures to put Bitcoin into a “vault” within the Bitcoin network involves a blend of these technologies to create a secure and flexible structure. The system would utilize designated vaults on the Bitcoin network, where only Sentinels have the authorization to interact with the deposits. Here’s an outline of how such a system could be designed, based on the information provided and the underlying principles of the technologies mentioned:\n[](#taproot-and-schnorr-multi-signatures-3)Taproot and Schnorr Multi-Signatures\nTaproot, introduced in BIP 341, enhances Bitcoin by enabling more privacy and efficiency in transactions. It allows for the combination of the Pay-to-PubKey (P2PK) and Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) spending conditions into a single new output type that is indistinguishable from others. Taproot takes advantage of Schnorr signatures, which allow for key aggregation - multiple public keys can be aggregated into a single one, requiring cooperation from all participants to sign for it .\n[](#xclaim-framework-4)xClaim Framework\nxClaim represents a framework for cross-chain claims, allowing assets to be represented and moved between different blockchains. In the context of creating vaults on the Bitcoin network, the xClaim framework could facilitate the representation of Bitcoin in these vaults, enabling assets to be locked in a Bitcoin transaction and then used within the Zenon Network or another chain.\n[](#system-design-5)System Design\n\n\nVault Creation: Utilize Taproot to create a vault, which is essentially a Bitcoin address that allows for flexible control over the funds through Schnorr signatures and MAST. The vault would be controlled by a script that includes conditions for depositing and withdrawing Bitcoin. The script is only revealed when the conditions are met, enhancing privacy.\n\n\nSentinel Authorization: Sentinels are special entities with the authority to approve transactions related to the vault. Their public keys are aggregated using Schnorr’s key aggregation feature, creating a single public key that represents the combined authority of the Sentinels. This aggregated key is used in the Taproot script for the vault, ensuring that only transactions approved by the Sentinels can spend the vault’s funds.\n\n\nDeposits and Withdrawals: To deposit Bitcoin into the vault, a user sends BTC to the vault’s address. The transaction would be structured to allow the Sentinels to execute a withdrawal based on predefined conditions, possibly involving interaction with the Zenon Network or another blockchain for cross-chain operations.\n\n\nCross-Chain Representation with xClaim: When Bitcoin is deposited into the vault, a corresponding representation of the BTC can be issued on the Zenon Network (or another chain), using the xClaim protocol. This process involves locking the Bitcoin in the vault and minting an equivalent amount of tokenized Bitcoin on the Zenon Network.\n\n\nSecurity Measures: To ensure security, the system can incorporate measures such as time-locks and hash-locks. Time-locks prevent funds from being prematurely withdrawn, giving enough time for any disputes to be resolved. Hash-locks can be used in cross-chain operations to ensure that actions on one chain (e.g., releasing the tokenized Bitcoin) are conditional upon actions on another chain (e.g., locking the actual Bitcoin in the vault).\n\n\nThis system leverages the security and flexibility of Bitcoin’s Taproot and Schnorr signatures to create secure vaults controlled by designated entities (Sentinels). By integrating with xClaim, it enables a seamless and secure cross-chain representation of Bitcoin, facilitating new use cases and interoperability between Bitcoin and other blockchains.\n\n[](#qa-with-chatgpt-on-the-proposed-design-6)Q&A with ChatGPT on the proposed design\nGiven the system design above, I asked ChatGPT if the vault design would allow Alice to deposit 1 BTC into the vault, receive 1 xBTC on NoM, transfer 0.5 xBTC to Bob, and allow Bob to withdraw 0.5 BTC from the vault.  Here is the response.\n\nYes, with the proposed system design, it is possible for Alice to deposit 1 BTC into the vault, receive 1 xBTC on the Zenon Network (or any other blockchain integrated with this system), send 0.5 xBTC to Bob on that network, and then allow Bob to withdraw his 0.5 xBTC back to native Bitcoin without impacting the remaining 0.5 BTC Alice owns in the vault. Here’s how this could be achieved:\n\n\nInitial Deposit: Alice deposits 1 BTC into the Bitcoin vault designed with Taproot and controlled by Sentinels. This action triggers the creation of 1 xBTC in the Zenon Network, representing Alice’s 1 BTC deposit.\n\n\nAlice Sends xBTC to Bob: Alice then sends 0.5 xBTC to Bob within the Zenon Network. This transaction is recorded on the Zenon Network, and Alice’s balance is updated to reflect that she now owns 0.5 xBTC.\n\n\nBob’s Withdrawal to Native Bitcoin:\n\nBob decides to withdraw his 0.5 xBTC to native Bitcoin. To facilitate this, the system checks the equivalent value in the Bitcoin vault.\nThe Sentinels, leveraging the xClaim protocol, verify Bob’s ownership of 0.5 xBTC on the Zenon Network. They then authorize a withdrawal from the vault corresponding to Bob’s 0.5 xBTC.\nA transaction is prepared, signed by the Sentinels (using their aggregated Schnorr signature), and broadcasted to the Bitcoin network. This transaction sends 0.5 BTC from the vault to Bob’s specified Bitcoin address.\nTo ensure that Alice’s remaining 0.5 BTC in the vault is not affected, the system updates the records on both the Bitcoin and Zenon Networks. This update reflects that 0.5 BTC has been withdrawn from the vault, and Alice still owns the remaining 0.5 xBTC on the Zenon Network.\n\n\n\nEnsuring Isolation of Withdrawals: The crucial part of this system is the ability to track and verify individual ownership and transactions of xBTC on the Zenon Network. By keeping detailed records and using cryptographic proofs, the system ensures that withdrawals only impact the specific portion of the BTC in the vault corresponding to the xBTC being redeemed.\n\n\nFinal State:\n\nAlice retains ownership of 0.5 xBTC on the Zenon Network, which is securely backed by 0.5 BTC in the vault.\nBob receives 0.5 BTC in his native Bitcoin address, completing the withdrawal process.\n\n\n\nThis process involves intricate coordination between the Bitcoin vault, the Zenon Network, and the Sentinels to ensure that transactions and withdrawals are securely and accurately processed. It showcases the potential for interoperable blockchain solutions, allowing for seamless asset transfers and withdrawals across different blockchains while maintaining the integrity and security of the underlying assets.\n\n[](#discussion-7)Discussion\nI think there are a number of issues with this design.  This implementation feels more like wrapped Bitcoin controlled by decentralized  actors.  In the lightning network either party in a liquidity channel can force a channel to close leaving them in “control” of the Bitcoin.  However, the parties likely need to rely on watchtowers, centralized entities in many cases, to prevent fraud after channels are closed.\nOn a positive note, according to ChatGPT, the vault is fungible.  Alice can deposit 1 BTC into the vault and Bob can remove his 0.5 BTC share after receiving that amount in xBTC.\nUnfortunately, the system does not address how to handle adding and subtracting sentinels from the network.  I asked ChatGPT how we can create a dynamic threshold signature scheme with hundreds of Sentinels that are constantly changing.  It proposed the following design which seems inflexible and impractical.\n[](#h-1-establishing-the-initial-threshold-scheme-8)1. Establishing the Initial Threshold Scheme\n\n\nKey Generation Ceremony: Initially, all Sentinels participate in a distributed key generation protocol. This process results in each Sentinel possessing a unique secret share and all Sentinels collectively sharing a public key that represents the entire group. This public key can be used to verify signatures generated by any subset of Sentinels meeting the threshold.\n\n\nThreshold Setting: The threshold is set at 66%, meaning that any transaction or action requires signatures from at least 66% of the current Sentinels to be considered valid.\n\n\n[](#h-2-adapting-to-changes-in-sentinel-membership-9)2. Adapting to Changes in Sentinel Membership\n\n\nJoining Sentinels: When new Sentinels are added, a rekeying process is initiated. This can be achieved through a distributed key generation protocol that includes the new Sentinels. The existing Sentinels and the new ones collaboratively generate new shares and a new aggregated public key, adjusting the threshold accordingly.\n\n\nLeaving Sentinels: When Sentinels leave or are removed, a similar rekeying process is necessary. The remaining Sentinels engage in a protocol to redistribute secret shares and generate a new public key that reflects the current set of Sentinels, ensuring the threshold is maintained.\n\n\n[](#h-3-ensuring-security-and-efficiency-10)3. Ensuring Security and Efficiency\n\n\nSecure Key Management: Each Sentinel must securely manage their secret share. Loss or compromise of secret shares can pose security risks. Advanced cryptographic techniques, secure hardware, or multi-party computation can be employed to safeguard these shares.\n\n\nEfficient Signature Generation and Verification: Given the potentially large number of Sentinels, it’s crucial to employ a threshold signature scheme that supports efficient signing and verification, even as the set of signers changes. Schnorr signatures are beneficial here due to their aggregation properties, but additional research into multi-signature and threshold signature optimizations may be needed.\n\n\nRobust Protocol for Dynamic Changes: Implementing a protocol that allows for dynamic changes in the Sentinel set requires careful consideration of network consensus, synchronization among Sentinels, and the potential for disputes or misbehavior. Blockchain technology or a distributed ledger could be utilized to transparently and securely manage these dynamics.\n\n\n[](#h-4-practical-considerations-11)4. Practical Considerations\n\n\nCommunication and Coordination: Effective communication channels and protocols must be established among Sentinels to coordinate the key generation, signing processes, and threshold adjustments. This coordination is critical during dynamic changes to the Sentinel set.\n\n\nLegal and Governance Framework: Depending on the system’s application and jurisdiction, a legal and governance framework may need to be established to define the roles, responsibilities, and procedures for adding or removing Sentinels.\n\n\nTesting and Auditing: Before deployment, the threshold signature scheme and its dynamic adjustment mechanisms should be thoroughly tested and audited by security experts to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.\n\n\nImplementing a dynamic threshold signature scheme with hundreds of Sentinels presents complex challenges but is feasible with careful cryptographic design and operational management. It offers a robust and flexible solution for managing permissions and actions in decentralized systems, leveraging the strengths of Schnorr signatures and threshold cryptography.\n[](#conclusion-12)Conclusion\nIf anyone wants to engage with my custom trained chatGPT bot to explore these ideas you can find it here: [ChatGPT - BTC Scaling on NoM](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-KySzqRGST-btc-scaling-on-nom).  I think we’ve come up with some interesting concepts with no workable solution.\nMaybe some of these concepts are directionally useful.  It seems like a highly skilled network architect could improve on these ideas to realize some of the goals established in the [Zenon Network website](https://zenon.network):\n\n“Atomic swaps and the decentralized cross-chain bridge will enable users to access and transfer value in a censorship resistant way, while unlocking new use-cases with enhanced portability.”\n“Interoperability with Bitcoin is a core focus to tap into the security and decentralization of the primordial time-chain.”\n\nI also think some of the concepts in [@georgezgeorgez](/u/georgezgeorgez) [article](https://medium.com/@georgezgeorgez/a-message-to-humans-an-aliens-guide-to-lightning-network-watchtower-limitations-and-beyond-96138967fa9b) relating to “flipping the script” make sense but relate more to making improvements to the Lightning Network.  Can these concepts be applied to xBTC on NoM?  I asked ChatGPT this question and it concluded that adding an approval > oracle > consensus layer to xBTC transactions on NoM would not provide additional security and would only slow transactions.\n[Screenshot 2024-03-17 at 5.11.59 AM1026×308 35.3 KB](//hypercore.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/original/1X/ed98397111691e35f6041aa01dca0403853b64c0.png)",

The first modal is clear, it’s a pairing. Is the next modal (the one asking for node/etc) a session?

I believe this is implementation specific and not necessarily related to WalletConnect.",

This sponsorship could include, but would not be limited to:\n-A dedicated 15-30 minute presentation on Zenon & NoM\n-A dedicated booth\n-Co-branding of the event\n-The ZNN-BTC logo created by [@mehowz](/u/mehowz) printed on several banners/flags/etc. hosted throughout the venue plus handouts for every attendee\n-Dedicated social and e-mail distribution to attendees\n-Invites to all VCs for a follow-on presentation on Zenon/NoM\n-Open to more suggestions but tl;dr it would be very clear who is sponsoring the Network State event.\nOur ask would be for 50K QSR from AZ to cover costs to ensure event has amenities listed above and additional event costs above and beyond the venue (food, drinks, extension for a social hour, etc.)\nPosting poll here and submit A-Z if 2/3 Yes votes.  Will only respond to thoughtful questions, comments, feedback, etc.\nIf event is well received and provides brand lift (and subsequent PA) for Zenon, can consider hosting another one at BTC Conference in Nashville this year.\nWould you support a 50K QSR request to sponsor the [Building Network States conference](https://x.com/buildcities/status/1750222203713392664?s=20)?\n\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n0\nvoters\n\n\n\n",

But am also open to a member from community giving a presentation should they feel comfortable.\nOn a separate note, given the support from the poll, was speaking with [@Shazz](/u/shazz) earlier about the alternative of doing a fundraiser outside of AZ in order to preserve AZ funds and just raise in USDC which is what is needed for vendor payments anyways (also would eliminate sell pressure of QSR though we would be careful here). $50 from 110 people aliens would do the trick…\nThoughts?\nShould we proceed with AZ submission or a USDC fundraiser for $5500 (the approx USD equivalent of original ask)?\n\n\nI would support an AZ submission for a 50K QSR event sponsorship\nI would support a $5500 USDC fundraise outside of A-Z for the sponsorship\n\n\n\n\n\n0\nvoters\n\n\n\n",

Some examples as follows:\n\n\nNetwork State Event 1:  Co-hosted, build_ responsible for venue only; $2K costs; Phase creation for $2K worth of ZNN and/or QSR with link to all receipts\n\n\nNetwork State Event 2:  Co-hosted, no financial responsibility required for build: no receipts = no phase creation\n\n\nNetwork State Event 3:  100% build_hosted, $4K venue + $3K food; Phase creation for $7K worth of ZNN and/or QSR with link to all receipts.\n\n\nNot all events will necessarily be “network state-oriented”, some may take the form of smaller gatherings of VIPs, etc. One of the other events that we are planning this year is a global CivicTech hackathon (10 cities, 10+ hacker houses, virtual panels/speakers hosted in build) that will actually be lesser overhead than IRL events but really demonstrate the capabilities of what we are building.\nRegardless, we will exercise best judgment to maximize value for our respective endeavors in a way that is flexible and efficient.\nZenon placements could include, but not limited to, all the placements we conducted at ETH Denver and I’m sure can be further refined as we evolve.\nWe think this is as good of a time as any to cement the BTC <> Zenon <> Network State narrative as it is a powerful one and gets the attention of some of the most frontier operators and investors in crypto.  As such, wanted to get another temp check:\nWould you support a full AZ sponsorship submission that is released in phases on a per-event basis (with receipt documentation)?  One Phase = One Event.\n\n\nYes\nYes (with modifications - see replies)\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n0\nvoters\n\n\n\n",

The plasma generation loop is by design, because the auto-receiver will try to receive the tx until success.\nThe difference is that I’m getting an error notification after the plasma generation notification wereas in your case you keep getting only plasma generation notifications.

Should this not be the case in syrius?\n\n\nCurrently the chain id mismatch only warns the user. It is assumed the user knows what he’s doing.\nMetamask works differently because it has predefined networks to choose from. They have to be configured explicitly beforehand.\nSyrius allows both the node url and chain id to be used interchangeable. Which is not necessarily a good thing.\nThe chain id and node url are to my knowledge bound to eachother. Meaning you cannot connect the hc1 node with chain id other than 1. While other nodes are specifically meant for testing. So it makes sense to combine both the node url and chain id in one single configration.\nOne other limitation of the node management screen while onboarding is that you cannot specify the chain id. So for example, if you want to create a new wallet and connect a testnet. You first have to connect to the testnet node using chain id 1 while onboarding and later goto settings and change the chain id.\nIn general changing the chain id only has to done for testnets or devnets. The average user should not directly be bothered.\nI think the node management needs to be redesigned, but later for another future release.",

        "text": "The [XCLAIM](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/643.pdf) whitepaper was released in 2018.\nThe Taproot upgrade occurred in November 2021.\nI’ve researched the Polkadot implementation of XCLAIM and considered the potential improvements resulting from the unique architecture (including a node decoupled from consensus) of NoM and the advent of the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade. This exploration speculates on how these advancements could enhance the protocol for cryptocurrency-backed assets.\ndisclaimer: I have no idea what I’m talking about. This is all based on a video of a 3D redendering of a sentinel eating a BTC.\n[](#xclaim-1)XCLAIM\n[XCLAIM](https://xclaim.io/) comprises three main protocol ideas: Issue, Use, and Redeem.\n[](#issue-2)Issue\nUsers mint BTC in NoM by locking BTC with Sentinels  — non-trusted intermediaries.\n[](#use-3)Use\nEnjoy feeless and smart BTC transactions, powered by alien technology.\n[](#redeem-4)Redeem\nUsers burn BTC on NoM to unlock their corresponding BTC from Sentinels on Bitcoin.\nBTC on NoM can indefinitely enjoy all the benefits, including feeless transactions, like any other ZTS.\n[](#secure-open-efficient-5)Secure, Open, Efficient\nXCLAIM ensures users can redeem their BTC back on Bitcoin at any time. How? Taproot.\n(Tap)Rooted in a financially secure design, intermediaries (Sentinels) do not need to pledge collateral or prove correct behavior, thanks to Taproot. It’s enforced on the Bitcoin side by default, eliminating any theft attempts.\n[](#dynamic-and-permissionless-6)Dynamic and Permissionless\nAny user can become their own intermediary by deploying a Sentinel, simply, anytime, and without asking for permission.\nNote: in XCLAIM, any user can become a vault. It’s an open system. I’m speculating we want to only allow sentinels to behave as BTC vaults. This might not be the case.\n[](#censorship-resistant-7)Censorship Resistant\nBy design, Sentinels have no influence over the issuance process. An embedded NoM contract controls the issuance of BTC on NoM, ensuring no Sentinel can prevent a user from obtaining BTC on NoM.\n[](#fast-and-efficient-8)Fast and Efficient\nThanks to the XCLAIM protocol, the system is 95% more efficient than traditional HTLC atomic swaps. With NoM feeless properties, I’m gonna go with 99.9% efficiency.\n[](#now-lets-dig-deeper-into-the-blackhole-9)Now… let’s dig deeper into the Blackhole.\nNow, let’s delve deeper into the concept of a “Liquidity Blackhole” and piece the whole system together in NoM.\nXCLAIM is designed to be open and permissionless. For this reason, any user can assume multiple roles simultaneously or leave the system whenever they wish. Choose your preferred role from:\n[](#users-10)Users\nThere are two types of XCLAIM users on NoM:\n\n\nEnd-users obtain BTC on NoM from LPs and enjoy feeless and smart BTC. Requirements: (1) s y r i u s wallet.\n\n\nLiquidity Providers (LPs): Lock BTC with Sentinels to mint the equivalent counterpart on NoM through an embedded contract. Requirements: (1) BTC wallet and (2) s y r i u s wallet.\n\n\nBoth can redeem BTC natively on Bitcoin at any time (requires a BTC wallet).\n[](#sentinels-11)Sentinels\nSentinels are XCLAIM enablers who hold BTC locked on Bitcoin in a Taproot Script. Owing to their unique characteristics within NoM, they perform two critical roles within the XCLAIM system:\n\n\nValidators: By having direct access to the NoM consensus, any sentinel can verify it. Requirement: (1) a znnd full node.\n\n\nRelayers: Ensure NoM is up-to-date with Bitcoin’s state by submitting block headers to an embedded contract, acting as an on-chain SPV client. Relayers also flag potentially invalid blocks and transactions. Requirements: (1) a Bitcoin Full Node and (2) a NoM embedded contract implementation. This functionality can potentially be delegated to [@MoonBaze](/u/moonbaze)’s [haulers](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/merge-mining-feasiblity/381).\n\n\nRequirement: TBD (1) BTC wallet\nAll roles are coordinated using NoM embedded contracts, which include the functionality for issuing and redeeming BTC. This takes advantage of the decentralized and feeless properties of the network. One of the original concerns of XCLAIM was the cost of transactions as volume increases.\n[](#from-btc-to-nom-step-by-step-12)From BTC to NoM, Step by Step\nLeveraging the work done by XCLAIM, the system has two main functions: Issue and Redeem.\n[](#issue-13)Issue\nA user mints BTC on NoM by following these steps:\n\nSubmit an on-chain issue request with a Sentinel of their choosing.\nSend the BTC to the Sentinel.\nSubmit a transaction proof to the BTC SPV embedded contract.\nThe SPV embedded contract verifies the Bitcoin transaction.\nThe user is allocated the equivalent amount of newly minted BTC on NoM.\n\n[](#redeem-14)Redeem\nA user redeems BTC on NoM for the equivalent BTC on Bitcoin through the following process:\n\nTo initiate a redemption, a user locks (or burns?) BTC on NoM with an embedded contract.\nThe embedded contract instructs a Sentinel to execute the redemption on Bitcoin.\nThe Sentinel releases the correct amount of BTC to the user.\n\nThanks to Taproot, there is no need to manage the redeem transaction proof explicitly.\nAnd enabling…\n[](#a-liquidity-blackhole-powered-by-orbital-program-15)A Liquidity Blackhole Powered by Orbital Program\nGeneralizing the idea above, any token on any chain can be locked within a Sentinel vault. This approach incentivizes cross-chain swaps with the same guarantees and user experience provided by XCLAIM, without the inconveniences of traditional atomic swap-based systems.\nBy incentivizing Liquidity Providers (LPs) with real yield at the protocol level, and offering a feeless, smart, and scalable protocol that builds on the shoulders of giants—open and permissionless systems like Bitcoin and XCLAIM—the system will absorb all cryptocurrency liquidity into what can aptly be described as the Network of Momentum Liquidity Blackhole.",

They hold 20600 native ZNN today (it was swapped from Alpha Net) and it is owned by the community.  In order to activate trading they need to move this to wZNN and incur the 3% bridge tax.

Moreover, Zenon extends the utility beyond mere transactions, envisioning a comprehensive ecosystem that supports a wide range of applications and services.\n\n[](#anti-spam-mechanisms-1)Anti-Spam Mechanisms\nNano faces challenges with its anti-spam measures, which are crucial for maintaining network performance without transaction fees. Zenon Network introduces a novel approach through the Albedo upgrade, incorporating advanced anti-spam mechanisms that are dynamically adjusted based on network conditions. This ensures that the network remains resilient against spam attacks without compromising on scalability or user experience.\n[](#incentivization-and-capped-supply-2)Incentivization and Capped Supply\nNano’s capped supply, with no further issuance, raises concerns about long-term security and validator incentivization. Zenon Network introduces the concept of Network of Momentum (NoM), a dual-ledger system designed to ensure continuous incentivization. NoM allows for a dynamic issuance model that rewards network participants, including validator nodes, through staking and participation in the network’s consensus mechanism. This creates a sustainable ecosystem where validators are properly incentivized for their contributions to network security and integrity.\n[](#validator-incentivization-3)Validator Incentivization\nOne of the critical issues with Nano is the lack of direct incentives for validator nodes. Zenon Network’s NoM mechanism addresses this by integrating staking rewards and transaction fees into the consensus process. Validators in the Zenon Network are rewarded for their efforts in securing the network, creating a more robust and incentive-aligned ecosystem. This encourages participation and investment in the network’s health and growth.\n[](#beyond-a-medium-of-exchange-4)Beyond a Medium of Exchange\nWhile Nano focuses on being a medium of exchange, Zenon Network expands its utility by supporting a wide range of functionalities beyond simple transactions. The Zenon Network is designed to be a comprehensive platform for decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi) services. This opens up a vast landscape of possibilities for developers and users, making Zenon not just a currency but a foundational layer for the future of decentralized technology.\n[](#conclusion-5)Conclusion\nZenon Network represents a significant evolution in blockchain technology, addressing the limitations of Nano and offering a robust platform for the development of innovative applications. Its innovative consensus mechanism, NoM, ensures that the network remains secure, scalable, and continuously incentivized, making it an attractive proposition for the Nano community and beyond. Zenon Network invites developers, users, and enthusiasts from the Nano community to explore its rich ecosystem and contribute to its growth. Together, we can build a more inclusive, efficient, and decentralized future.\nNote: For more specific details on the Zenon Network’s mechanisms and functionalities, refer to the Zenon Whitepaper or reach out to the community for in-depth discussions and technical resources.",

User-selected representative nodes vote on each transaction, and every node independently [cements](https://docs.nano.org/glossary/#cementing) each transaction after seeing enough representative votes to achieve [quorum](https://docs.nano.org/glossary/#quorum).\nWhile Nano uses a weighted-voting system that can be compared to PoS, it differs significantly from traditional PoS. See the [Open Representative Voting (ORV)](https://docs.nano.org/protocol-design/orv-consensus/) page for more details.\nNano achieves consensus via a balance-weighted vote on conflicting transactions. This consensus system provides quicker, more deterministic transactions while still maintaining a strong, decentralized system. Nano continues this development and has positioned itself as one of the highest performing cryptocurrencies.\n\n[](#protocol-design-ledger-4)Protocol Design - Ledger\n[](#ledger-design-5)Ledger Design\nThe Nano ledger is the global set of accounts where each account has its own chain of transactions ([Figure 1](https://docs.nano.org/protocol-design/ledger/#account-chains-diagram)). This is a key design component that falls under the category of replacing a run-time agreement with a design-time agreement - everyone agrees via signature checking that only an account owner can modify the balance and representative on their own chain. This converts a seemingly shared data structure (a global blockchain) into a set of non-shared ones (individual account-chains).\nEach Nano node determines for itself whether or not to add a valid transaction to its local ledger. This means that there is no waiting for leader-selection as there is in single-blockchain cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, where a single miner or staker extends the global blockchain with a new block (group of transactions) after solving a Proof-of-Work or being chosen through random selection. The block lattice ledger design removes this bottleneck, drastically decreasing transaction latency, improving decentralization, and simplifying transaction validation. Nano has no concept of block sizes or block times that arbitrarily limit the number of transactions that can be processed - the network will confirm as many transactions as current network conditions allow.\n[image641×601 17.1 KB](//hypercore.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/original/1X/b80f43eb13a867d0fdc3d2f630bff6567449c981.png)\n[](#accounts-6)Accounts\nAccount owners are the only ones who can modify the balance and representative on their own account chains and thus contention only happens on a per-account basis or in relation to epoch distributions[1](https://docs.nano.org/protocol-design/ledger/#fn:1).\nFor example, if account A attempts a double spend that must be resolved by the network, account B can still make transactions as normal. Transactions are processed independently and asynchronously.\n[](#blocks-7)Blocks\nIn Nano, a block contains the details of a single transaction. There are four different transaction types in Nano (send, receive, change representative and epoch) and in order to transfer funds, two transactions are required - a send transaction and a receive transaction.\n[](#why-require-two-transactions-to-transfer-8)Why require two transactions to transfer\n\nSending of funds can be performed while the receiver is offline\nAccount owners are the only ones who are allowed to modify the balance and representative on their accounts\nAllows account owners to ignore transactions, which prevents continuous sending of tiny amounts in an attempt to prevent use of the account\n\n[](#block-latice-9)Block Latice\nThe lattice structure of the ledger arises from blocks connecting across account-chains. All block types use the previous field to vertically extend the account-chain. In addition, send and receive blocks also use the link field to connect across account-chains. [Figure 3](https://docs.nano.org/protocol-design/ledger/#block-lattice-diagram) below illustrates the lattice structure at a high level with additional details about blocks available on the [blocks](https://docs.nano.org/protocol-design/blocks/) page.\n[image921×581 35.9 KB](//hypercore.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/original/1X/66678832a1f5f2c24e8cb34581d580ee9bebdc6f.png)\n[](#ledger-pruning-10)Ledger Pruning\nSince every transaction in Nano includes a block with the complete current state of an account, the ledger can be significantly pruned. While there are a few exceptions (e.g. pending transactions), Nano’s ledger design could be pruned down to one block per account (plus pending), regardless of how many transactions the account has sent or received.\n[](#protocol-design-blocks-11)Protocol Design - Blocks\n[](#state-blocks-12)State Blocks\nAll new transactions on the Nano Protocol are communicated via blocks. The account’s entire state, including the balance after each transaction, is recorded in every block. Transaction amounts are interpreted as the difference in balance between consecutive blocks.\n[](#account-balance-13)Account Balance\nIf an account balance decreases, the transaction that caused the decrease is considered a send. Similarly, if an account balance increases, the transaction that caused the increase is considered a receive.\n[](#block-vs-transaction-14)Block vs transaction\nIn traditional blockchain-based cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, a block is a group of transactions. In Nano, a block is a single transaction, so the term “block” and “transaction” are often used interchangeably. “Transaction” specifically refers to the action, while block refers to the digital encoding of the transaction. Transactions are signed by the private-key belonging to the account on which the transaction is performed.\n[](#creating-transactions-15)Creating transactions\n[](#open-receive-16)Open (receive)\nTo create an account, an open transaction must be issued first. This is always the first transaction (block height 1) of every account-chain and can be created upon the first receipt of funds. To open an account, you must have sent some funds to it with a send transaction from another account. The funds will be pending on the receiving account. The account field stores the public-key (address) derived from the private-key that is used for signing. The link field contains the hash of the transaction that sent the funds. On account creation, a representative must be chosen to vote on your behalf; this can be changed later. The account can declare itself as its own representative.\n[](#send-17)Send\nA send transaction is one that decreases the sender’s account balance by the amount they intend to send. To send from an address, the address must already have been opened with an open (receive) block and therefore will have a balance. The previous field contains the hash of the previous block in the account-chain. The link field contains the account for funds to be sent to. A send block is immutable once confirmed by the network. This means the funds are deducted from the balance of the sender’s account and wait as pending until the receiving party signs a block to accept these funds.\n[](#receive-18)Receive\nA receive block is very similar to the send block mentioned above, except the account balance is increasing and the link field contains the send block’s hash. To complete a transaction, the recipient of sent funds must create a receive block on their own account-chain. The source field references the hash of the associated send transaction. Once this block is created and broadcasted, the account’s balance is updated and the funds have officially moved into their account.\n[](#change-rep-19)Change rep\nNano account holders have the ability to choose a representative to vote on their behalf. This can be done any time (i.e. in an open, send, or receive transaction) by changing the representative field. In conventional PoS systems, the account owner’s node must be continuously running to participate in voting. This is impractical for many users, so to remove this requirement Nano was designed to give a representative the power to vote on an account’s behalf. A change transaction is what changes the representative of an account by subtracting the vote weight from the old representative and adding the weight to the new representative. No funds are moved in this transaction, and the representative does not have spending power of the account’s funds.\n[](#epoch-blocks-20)Epoch blocks\nSince all accounts on the Nano network are asynchronous, an asynchronous form of chain upgrades is needed. Unlike Bitcoin and other traditional blockchains, Nano is not able to say “upgrade at block X”, so Epoch blocks were one of the approaches developed to solve this problem.\nEpoch blocks are a special block type that can only be generated using a pre-determined private key currently owned by the [Nano Foundation](https://nano.org/foundation). These blocks will be accepted by nodes and be attached as the frontier blocks on each account-chain on the network. This feature was built to allow very limited controls using these blocks: they cannot change account balances or representatives, only upgrade the account versions to allow new block structures. Furthermore, if the majority of the network does not upgrade to a new node version that enables a particular epoch block, then the epoch block will have minimal or no effect.\n[](#protocol-design-spam-work-and-prioritization-21)Protocol Design - Spam, Work and Prioritization\n[](#spam-resistance-22)Spam resistance\nA spam transaction is loosely defined as a block broadcasted with the intent to saturate the network, reduce network availability, or increase the size of the ledger. In order to make spam more costly, each valid block in Nano requires a proof-of-work (PoW) solution to be attached to it - similar to the original Hashcash proposition[1](https://docs.nano.org/protocol-design/spam-work-and-prioritization/#fn:1). Participants can compute the required work in a few seconds, and verification time for this work is negligible (to prevent invalid blocks, large work, and/or invalid work from becoming a denial-of-service attack vector). The cost of spamming the network then increases linearly with the number of spam transactions, reducing the impact of spam from theoretically infinite to a manageable amount.\nIn addition to proof-of-work, another key component of Nano’s defense against spam is transaction prioritization using a round-robin balance-bucket system, combined with least-recently-used (LRU) prioritization within those buckets. This system ensures that spam does not prevent legitimate users from making transactions & achieving fast confirmation, which in turn removes some of the incentives to spam (e.g. network disruption).\nRead more about their upgraded [anti-spam mechanism](https://open.substack.com/pub/senatus/p/the-bucketing-system-prioritizing?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web).\nNano is under attack again.  Read more about it in Reddit. [Reddit - Dive into anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1b3v804/nano_is_under_spam_attack_days_after_anti_spam/)\n[](#protocol-design-orv-consensus-23)Protocol Design - ORV Consensus\n[](#overview-24)Overview\nIn order to protect against [double spending](https://docs.nano.org/protocol-design/attack-vectors/#50-attack) and [Sybil attacks](https://docs.nano.org/protocol-design/attack-vectors/#sybil-attack-to-change-ledger-entries), Nano uses a unique consensus mechanism called Open Representative Voting (ORV). In ORV, user-selected representative nodes vote on each transaction, and every node (representative or not) independently [cements](https://docs.nano.org/glossary/#cementing) each transaction after seeing enough representative votes to achieve [quorum](https://docs.nano.org/protocol-design/orv-consensus/#quorum). Since Nano transactions are processed individually and asynchronously, deterministic finality (irreversible, full-settlement) is achieved in a short period of time, typically less than 1 second.\nDue to Nano’s [block-lattice ledger design](https://docs.nano.org/protocol-design/ledger/), only account owners have the ability to sign blocks into their account-chains, so all forks must be the result of poor programming or malicious intent (double-spend) by the account owner, which means that nodes can easily make policy decisions on how to handle forks without affecting legitimate transactions.\nBecause Nano accounts can freely delegate their voting weight to representatives at any time, the users have more control over who has power with consensus and how decentralized the network is. Also note that delegation of voting weight does not mean staking of any funds - the account delegating can still spend all their available funds at any time without restrictions. This is a key advantage to the design of [Open Representative Voting (ORV)](https://docs.nano.org/glossary/#open-representative-voting-orv). With no direct monetary incentive for nodes, this removes emergent centralization forces for longer-term trending toward decentralization of the network.\nWhile Nano uses a weighted-voting system ([ORV](https://docs.nano.org/protocol-design#orv-consensus)) that can be compared to PoS, it differs from traditional PoS because:\n\nThere is not one monolithic blockchain that requires leader selection (i.e. a staker or a miner) to extend\nRepresentatives do not create or produce shared blocks (groups of transactions)\nEach Nano account has its own blockchain that only the owner can modify (representatives can only modify their own blockchain)\nIn Nano, a block is a single transaction (not a group of transactions).

        "text": "That is a fairly interesting summary of Nano. We can learn a lot from it, but the interesting part is where Zenon and Nano differ.\n“Nano has one token and NoM has two.” This is not correct; NoM has the ability to issue tokens, so there is no limit to how many tokens we can have. This leads into a major advantage Zenon has over Nano: the embedded contracts/functions. Nano is primarily designed to be digital cash, focusing on sending and receiving transactions. In contrast, embedded functions allow diverse behaviors on the NoM platform. This includes Zts, Zats, NFTs, staking, delegating, and any other kind of functionality that can be embedded in the network.\n“Nano uses a weighted voting system (like PoS but different) for consensus, and NoM uses PoW links + PoW and PoS + virtual voting (or will eventually).” If we want to compare Nano with Zenon, it’s best to compare Nano with the alphanet as it currently is, to compare apples to apples. NoM does not use PoW links, PoW, POS, or virtual voting. What does it use? I’m not entirely sure; it must be some sort of voting mechanism similar to Nano’s, along with something to publish the momentums. Perhaps someone else could provide more insight into how exactly the consensus works.\nAnother advantage that Zenon has over Nano is its use of Plasma as a network resource asset to manage spam, congestion, transaction ordering, storage, etc.\nWhile Nano has only send and receive blocks, Zenon can have many different types of blocks, allocating tiers of expense to their usage.\nZenon also features a spork that allows for the incorporation of new functionalities.\nAnd there are probably more things too that I can’t think of right now.",

        "text": "[](#issue-1)Issue\nPillar voting is very low.  We generally have 30 Pillars consistently voting which is barely enough to approve AZs and funding requests.  In addition, Pillars who control more than one can single handedly kill a vote by simply not voting.  Our system was designed to promote a democracy with decentralization, not a monopoly with centralization.\nHow can we improve voting and engagement by Pillars?\n[](#proposed-solution-2)Proposed Solution\nEncrypted messaging in syrius.  If we can send messages to Pillars they might read them and consider voting.\n[](#background-3)Background\n[@sol](/u/sol) [@vilkris](/u/vilkris) and [@aliencoder](/u/aliencoder) have investigated messaging solutions.  We have also discussed this topic with Mr. Kaine in TG.\n\n[@vilkris](/u/vilkris) developed a [PoC Encrypted Messaging Solution](https://forum.zenon.org/t/secret-messages-poc/1183)\n[@aliencoder](/u/aliencoder) found a [Dart Implementation of the Signal Protocol](https://forum.zenon.org/t/secret-messages-poc/1183/6?u=0x3639)\n[@sol](/u/sol)  Came up with a [message field in the transfer agent.](https://forum.zenon.org/t/rfc-syrius-message-field-in-transfer-widget/864)\n\nPillars do yield farm even if they don’t vote.  If we can send them encrypted messages and show a notification it’s possible they will look at a message. If they will look at a message, we can ask them to look at and/or vote on an AZ or funding request.\n[](#proposal-4)Proposal\n\nAdd messaging functionality to the C# cli that leverage the work that [@vilkris](/u/vilkris) did on messaging.\nUse the cli to send encrypted messages to addresses in NoM. By limiting the message generation to the cli it’s possible we can reduce spam.  Barriers to create messages are higher.\nAdd a notification in syrius when an address receives an encrypted message\nAdd a display window to read the message.\nConsider adding a fee to see a message in syrius.  Meaning, for a user to send a message they must pay x znn for that message to appear in the users wallet.  If no fee is paid, the message will not appear.  This will be enforced in syrius, and not the L1.\nWe could also consider creating a messaging token that is used to send messages.  And that token must be purchased.  Maybe the dev who codes this could benefit from selling that token.  This is not necessary.  It’s just an idea.\n\n[](#issues-5)Issues\n\nMr Kaine encouraged us to reduce chain bloat.  And this could encourage spam. However, users will not see messages unless a fee is paid.  We could also deposit this fee into AZ.\nCan we limit message size?  Maybe we can enforce the message size at the cli level.\n",

I think the quorum is 33% of all active Pillars?  Maybe the calculation excludes inactive pillars from the quorum.  That way Pillars who do vote usually are incentives to actually vote if they want to be considered in a quorum.\nI do find it curious that 2 Pillars who never vote actually run Orchestrators.  At a minimum, why include Pillars with zero votes in the quorum?\nWe currently have 23 pillars who have never voted.  If we remove them from the quorum (99 - 23 = 76 x .33 = 25).

We have come up with an idea to create a file called mainnet-rpc-node-db.json that would live in a new /zenon-network repo.  See the proposed repo here:  [https://github.com/KingGorrin/zenon-node-database](https://github.com/KingGorrin/zenon-node-database).\nIn this .json file we could include a list of Public RPC Nodes like this:\n{\n  \"HyperCore-One\": {\n    \"url\": \"wss://my.hc1node.com:35998\"\n  },\n  \"Zenon Hub\": {\n    \"url\": \"wss://node.zenonhub.io:35998\"\n  }\n}\n\nWhen we build syrius and other applications, they can pull in this file and use it when we build the binary.  Putting this information in a separate repo and easily accessible file will make it “ez” for the community to see it and propose changes.\nIn addition, we can also expand this idea to include more information, like what is proposed below:\n\"name\":\"Zenon Mainnet\",\n\"chain\":\"ZNN\",\n\"icon\":\"zenon\",\n\"infoURL\":\"https://zenon.network\",\n\"shortName\":\"znn\",\n\"chainId\":1,\n\"networkId\":1,\n\"rpc\":[\n\t\"wss://my.hc1node.com:35998\",\n\t\"wss://node.zenonhub.io:35998\"\n],\n\"faucets\":[],\n\"nativeCurrency\":{\"name\":\"Zenon\",\"symbol\":\"ZNN\",\"decimals\":18},\n\"explorers\":[{\"name\":\"Zenon Explorer\",\"url\":\"https://explorer.zenon.org\"}]\n\n\nThe alternative is to hard code the Public RPC Nodes into the code or create a .json for each application, but that could be hard to manage and duplicate information needed in multiple apps.\nDo you guys have any opinions on this idea?  If not, we will move forward as proposed.",

This caused a fork at block 6606106.\nWe believe the sort.Slice function caused the fork, identical to what happened with the AZ fork.  If you want to read about that issue, see [this post](https://github.com/zenon-network/go-zenon/pull/26#issuecomment-1674697126).\nWe fixed this last time by changing to Stable Sort.  [@sumamu](/u/sumamu) is looking into this.  I hope we can test and deploy a fix quickly.\nI think most pillars are on the main chain, which is why many people have not noticed.  I’ve reached out to a few Pillars who I know are forked out.  I have several nodes that are forked out, but the public node wss://my.hc1node.com:35998 is on the main chain.\nUntil we get things sorted out I recommend not bridging assets, but when [@sumamu](/u/sumamu) reads this tomorrow he might have different advice.  [@digitalSloth](/u/digitalsloth) was the first person to notice it and since then we’ve been investigating most of the day.\nIf you operate a node or pillar run sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep \"znnd\" to see if you are processing blocks.  If you are forked you will be stuck on 6606105 and you won’t see any new momentums in the logs.  The znnd process will reboot every few minutes.\nStay tuned for more info zoon™.",

The concentration of hashrate into the hands of a few centralized pools is dangerous for a number of reasons.\n[](#properties-3)Properties\nBy integrating the first decentralized, peer-to-peer (merge)-mining pool for Bitcoin & RandomX and several other algorithms, we aim to enhance the following properties that are at the core of our shared ethos:\n[](#censorship-resistance-4)Censorship-resistance\nThere is no centralized server to steal hashrate, impose a certain block template for example mining empty blocks in Bitcoin or even worse blacklisting certain transactions. We already see that centralized mining pools in certain jurisdictions can be targeted and forced to comply.\n[](#decentralization-5)Decentralization\nBy communicating exclusively through the peer-to-peer network, miners coordinate by working on a share-chain. If properly implemented, it can be as efficient as a centralized pool.\nThere is no pool admin: attacks by rogue pool operators on Bitcoin are no longer possible.\nMoreover, miners with older ASICs can turn them on even if they have a lower hashrate and contribute on a lower difficulty share-chain and still be profitable.\n[](#merge-mining-btc-znn-6)Merge-mining BTC & ZNN\nBy directing hashpower to NoM, miners will earn ZNN rewards from Pillars. We need to divert ZNN away from delegators in order to be able to properly incentivize miners and lay out the foundation for Phase 1.\nBitcoins will be generated. TSS will be leveraged for a decentralized custody of the freshly mined BTC. ZNN will be backed by physical BTC. This positive feedback loop aims to encourages participation and further decentralizes the distribution of the hashpower.\n[](#ledger-weight-7)Ledger weight\nIn Nakamoto consensus, participants choose the heaviest chain that has the most hashpower invested into it. The share-chains obtained with PoW will be embedded contracts with account-chains that will add up to NoM’s ledger weight and be used to “anchor” the consensus as described in the whitepaper.\n[](#dynamic-difficulty-8)Dynamic difficulty\nHere comes into play the CPU-friendly PoW algorithm: a separate share-chain based on RandomX (can be merge-mined with Monero) where miners can generate share-blocks. This share-chain will be used to compute a threshold for the dynamic difficulty for PoW (CPU-friendly) feeless transactions.\n[](#pow-links-9)PoW links\nSentinel nodes relay only transactions with a minimum amount of (RandomX) PoW. Transactions (account-blocks) must have the minimum PoW threshold to be accepted by the network and further relayed to other Sentinel nodes. This creates a competition to “mine” transactions in order to be able to successfully route them through the network. Sentinels should be paid on the amount of transactions they have routed in any given epoch. Remember Sentinels generate both ZNN and QSR. Interesting design choice. (work in progress)\n[](#znn-fee-10)ZNN fee\nIn order to achieve global scale and global adoption, clients submitting transactions should be able to avoid computing PoW, especially if they are on battery powered devices. Fusing QSR requires PoW, so we must adopt a third option that will take into account another critical aspect of a healthy network: incentivizing the peer-to-peer layer comprised of full nodes. Therefore, clients should be able to attach a ZNN fee to their transaction that will be divided downstream between all the full nodes that propagate the transaction. Initially I’ve proposed burning the fee, but it doesn’t solve the incentive problem of full nodes that are costly to operate and much needed for a decentralized and censorship-resistant p2p layer.\nStay tuned for the next chapter: the implementation (work in progress).\n[](#network-participants-11)Network participants\n\nPillars: generate ZNN\nSentinels: generate ZNN & QSR\nDelegators: generate ZNN\nStakers: generate QSR\nLiquidity Providers: generate ZNN & QSR\nMiners: generate ZNN & QSR\nFull nodes: generate ZNN\n\nIn NoM Phase 1 there will be two new first class network participants:\n\nMiners: supply hashpower to the network. They will be rewarded in ZNN and QSR (redirected from delegators, stakers and Sentinels)\nFull nodes: the backbone of the p2p network that relay transactions. They will receive ZNN for relaying transactions throughout the network.\n\nOpen questions:\n\nPerpetual AZ funding: how to replenish AZ funds?\nZNN burn: we cannot burn part of the fees because we sabotage the sybil-resistance property of the p2p layer.\n\n[](#implementation-12)Implementation\nIn order to actually implement those ideas we need to build upon several building blocks.\n[](#primitives-building-blocks-13)Primitives & Building Blocks\n[](#threshold-signature-scheme-14)Threshold signature scheme\nRequired to hold and spend BTC in a trustless manner. Top Pillars will run a [FROST](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost) / [ROAST](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550.pdf) / [Sparkle](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/445.pdf) TSS ceremony to jointly create a key for the decentralized custody of the BTC. We can either integrate this directly into znnd or into the orchestrator binary.\nThe on-chain BTC will be used to pay for block space e.g. to create [tapscripts](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/tapscript/).\nThe Pillars already run full znnd full nodes and must also run the bitcoind full node to communicate with the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network.\n[](#merge-mined-share-chain-15)Merge-mined share-chain\nA new embedded contract for the share-chain. Embedded contracts have an account-chain [structure](https://zenon.tools/accounts/z1qxemdeddedxdrydgexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxmqgr0d) that is suited to host a share-chain.\nThe share-chain is basically a separate blockchain that is merge-mined with the target blockchain. In our case we have Bitcoin (ASIC-friendly, used to add weight to the ledger and Monero (CPU-friendly, used to compute the minimum difficulty for feeless transactions via PoW).\nThe best part is that our network already has the data structure required to build the share-chain: the account-chain of the embedded contract. Also the account-chain is guaranteed to have ordering by NoM consensus. This is important for accounting purposes, such that miners that participated and created valid shares (account-blocks) are incentivized by Pillars with delegation rewards.\n\nBitcoin merge-mining: embedded contract for SHA-256d\n\nZNN is backed by BTC, so it means that miners are already are paid in BTC (if ZNN will be redeemable in BTC) and also capture the potential upside of ZNN. If ZNN rewards aren’t enough, we can set a flexible payout in BTC for the top x% miners that contributed with the most hashpower to the network during a given epoch. Pillars can independently access and attest this information from the embedded contract. It really boils down to how much hashpower we can attract on the network. We have the possibility to setup two competing merge-mined share-chains and only reward extra (with BTC) the highest difficulty share-chain. From what I’ve analyzed, Monero implemented this concept (mini-share-chain) where small miners (up to x hash/s) can participate. The idea is to avoid the variance caused by miners with more hashrate and the payouts will even out on longer timeframes.\n[](#dynamic-difficulty-algorithm-16)Dynamic difficulty algorithm\n\nMonero merge-mining: embedded contract for RandomX; due to [incentive incompatibility](https://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/papers/bitcoin.pdf), I suggest implementing 2 share-chains lite and max depending on the miner’s hashpower. The [difficulty algos](https://github.com/zawy12/difficulty-algorithms) will be computed such that all PoW transactions must satisfy the current difficulty.\n\n[](#hybrid-multi-lane-load-balancing-algorithm-17)Hybrid multi-lane load balancing algorithm\nLoad balancing algorithm that will dynamically adjust the size of transaction lanes based on ongoing user traffic:\n\nFeeless PoW lane with dynamic difficulty adjusted based on a weighted average of the CPU-friendly share-chain.\nFeeless QSR fusing lane.\nFee lane with ZNN that goes into the incentivization of full node transaction routing.\n\n[](#routing-algorithm-18)Routing algorithm\nWe can borrow ideas from [here](https://wiki.saito.io/consensus/sybil-proof) to create a new incentives layer for the peer-to-peer network of full nodes that relay transactions.\n[](#pow-links-19)PoW links\nSentinels must attach a PoW to every transaction and relay it to another Sentinel node before reaching a Pillar. This PoW can be outsourced to miners. Sentinels will compete for RandomX miners, creating a new economy around this model. Sentinel operators will be able to setup off-chain reward mechanisms for miners adding weight to the PoW links. We must also take into account the additional data that is added to every transaction. Sentinels should use an [aggregate signature scheme](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/papers/aggsurvey.pdf) - “reducing message size in secure routing protocols such as SBGP”.",

I have many questions, but I will restrain from bombarding you all at once.\nThe first question I have is: What is a Sentinel?\nThere is a recurring theme in your thoughts about incentivization. It seems that a portion of the minted ZNN and QSR is being dispensed by the Sentinel contract every day without tangible network contribution.\nThis is a peculiar situation. Either there is an intended purpose for a Sentinel yet to come, or those emissions could be used elsewhere more effectively.\nAn idea that seems cool to me (though I have no scope on the realities of the implementation) would be to have Sentinels as full nodes. Because of the incentive, it would be reasonable to target higher-end hardware. This could allow end users to run ‘light’ nodes as access points.\nEconomically, this could make sense as the price of ZNN and QSR rises against BTC and fiat, it becomes progressively more lucrative to run a Sentinel, causing more to come online to meet the demand.\nAdditionally, one could devise a system where the Sentinels keep each other honest and punish dishonest nodes.\nFrom a layman’s perspective, this seems like it could work, but I’m sure there are probably some glaring flaws here.\nI’m eager to read your views on this and your general thoughts on Sentinels as well.",

Sentinels are portrayed as trustless nodes that act as observers, requiring moderate resources. Additionally, there are Sentry nodes, described as basic nodes that are lightweight and store a pruned ledger. This setup closely resembles the one I described above.\nAll things considered it’s worth noting that the whitepaper is labeled as a draft, and there has been some deviation from it with the implementation of the alpha net.\nThe alphanet wiki is intriguing, as it defines a Sentinel as a full node in the “definitions” section ( [znn-wiki/definitions.md at master · zenon-network/znn-wiki · GitHub](https://github.com/zenon-network/znn-wiki/blob/master/definitions.md#sentinel-node) ).\nIn the “deploy” section, it states, “The znn-controller works only for Pillars for the moment. Sentinel support will be available after Alphanet launch.”\nSo, the question arises: Is it worthwhile to devise an incentivization process for remote full node operators if this Sentinel and Sentry dynamic will be implemented?\nAnd along the same line of reasoning, does the fee lane proposal for dynamic plasma make sense to implement under this circumstance?",

If the goal is to have lots of them, we probably cannot rely on sentinels alone as public nodes.\n\nThe central question is whether the goal is to have many Sentinels, how many are considered enough? It is not immediately obvious that more equals better.\nBitcoin, which I just looked up, has an estimated 13 thousand full nodes in the network. They help create consensus, where the longest chain is what individual nodes accept as the valid version of the blockchain. At least that’s how I understand it.\nHowever, we don’t have that design. Our Pillars agree on what the valid version of the blockchain is. As far as I can tell, our full nodes serve as a medium for the transactional layer, which is separated from the consensus layer.\nSo, in that sense, the question remains: how many Sentinels does one need for network stability?\nThe cost to launch a Sentinel is crucial as it protects from economic attacks, it makes it very difficult for an attacker to launch 100 Sentinels at once, for example.\nA large benefit for prospective operators is that the cost is redeemable when a Sentinel is revoked, making a Sentinel profitable after the first day (In ZNN & QSR scope).",

As I understand it, a Sentinel is a full node that is tasked with relaying messages a minimum of 3 hops and adds PoW links to each message.  Alien posted some recent research into this idea and why it’s valuable.  Maybe you read that paper.\n\n\n\n\n[The P2P Revolution: PoW links reloaded](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/the-p2p-revolution-pow-links-reloaded/248) [Development](/c/development/4)\n\n\n    I want to bring into the discussion this paper that was released quite recently: \n[A Simple Proof of Sybil-Proof](https://github.com/SaitoTech/papers/blob/main/sybil/A_Simple_Proof_of_Sybil_Proof_Lancashire-Parris_2023.pdf) \nAbstract \n\n“This paper offers a counter-proof to this claim, formally proving the existence of a \nmechanism that achieves sybil-proofness in a three-hop path.”\n\nConclusion \n\n\n“The routing-tax mechanism described in this paper fixes the sybilling problem by inverting the collective action problem that creates the incentive to sybil in the first place.” \n\n\n“With this in mind, we close b…\n  \n\nSo my original question was, why can’t the Sentinel serve as an incentivized public node in the network. They are a full node and they are incentivized.\nI guess I did not fully appreciate that nodes really don’t offer network security like BTC.  So if that is the case, why are more nodes better? Why aren’t Sentinel nodes enough as the main public node in the network.  And how many Sentinels are necessary to perform the message relay function and to act as a public node?\nI’ll look at the white paper again to try and learn more.",

Is it possible and advantageous to delegate or stake them to earn network yield, thereby fueling AZ?\nWe’ve repeatedly discussed various strategies to sustain AZ. In my view, this proposal is far more appealing than the redirection of emissions or any other more drastic measures we’ve previously considered. To elaborate, holders of wZNN, who are not currently utilizing NoM, can at any time bridge their tokens back to ZNN and start earning yields independently. Essentially, we’re looking at redirecting the yield from idle wZNN to support AZ. Moreover, this strategy involves shifting rewards from passive participants (delegators) to active ones (AZ contributors).\nIn a future where multiple blockchains coexist, the supply of wZNN is expected to be ample enough to continuously support AZ, allowing users to maintain full control over their tokens by bridging back and forth as they wish, thereby claiming their share of network emissions.\nI see this as a win-win, but I might be missing something really obvious.

Let’s even ignore how much better decentralized the set of signers will be.\nWe have a treasury, other projects have a treasury. My point is we are no better than them just because our treasury includes BTC because they can at any point convert part of their treasury to BTC. However, if the BTC is acquired by mining it, there is no trusted step before it reaches the treasury. If we now use the BTC to “pay” for ecosystem growth (devs, marketing, etc), we’ll be essentially wasting actionable, self-custodial, trustless BTC that can be used to interoperate with the base bitcoin layer (settle rollup states, closing channels, etc).",

The problem with such a wallet is obvious: if your seed is compromised, your funds are gone.\n[](#can-we-do-better-3)Can we do better?\n\nDistributed Trust: In seed-based wallets, the entire security hinges on the seed phrase. If this seed is compromised, all associated assets are at risk. In contrast, seedless wallets distribute trust across multiple key shards. An attacker would need to compromise multiple shards to gain control, significantly raising the security bar.\nReduced Single Points of Failure: By avoiding a single seed phrase, seedless wallets eliminate a critical single point of failure. This distributed approach to key management reduces the risk of total asset loss due to single key compromise.\n\n[](#key-shard-security-4)Key shard security\nThis is the most important aspect: the key shards must be encrypted and stored separately such that an attacker is unable to perform the keysign operation.\nExample for 2 out of 3 threshold setup:\n\nOne key shard protected by the secure enclave of the processor\nOne key shard backed up on a cloud provider\nOne key encrypted using a PIN or passphrase\n\nIn the future, it can be integrated in both Syrius desktop and Syrius mobile wallets.\nPS: I’m planning to apply for an AZ grant for this project.",

The attacker needs both your FaceID/TouchID and your passphrase in order to be able to perform a successful keysign ceremony. The 3rd shard (backup shard) can be safely stored on your Google Drive or iCloud account.\nSo the attacker must spoof your passphrase and compromise your Google Drive or iCloud account (assuming that he is not a nation-state that can break into the secure enclave), which is significantly harder than social engineering a user into giving up his mnemonic.",

        "username": "0x3639",
        "text": "Another article shared by [@aliencoder](/u/aliencoder) about ZK Rollups on Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n[Medium – 5 Feb 24](https://medium.com/@chainway_xyz/a-sovereign-zk-rollup-on-bitcoin-full-bitcoin-security-without-a-soft-fork-ca0389a0b658)\n\n\n\n[A Sovereign ZK Rollup on Bitcoin: Full Bitcoin Security Without a Soft Fork](https://medium.com/@chainway_xyz/a-sovereign-zk-rollup-on-bitcoin-full-bitcoin-security-without-a-soft-fork-ca0389a0b658)\nYou can follow the progress of Chainway’s Rollup, Citrea, here. This article is outdated in terms of architecture and sovereignty aspects.\n\nReading time: 7 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT Summary:\nThe article “A Sovereign ZK Rollup on Bitcoin: Full Bitcoin Security Without a Soft Fork” by Chainway, published on September 19, 2023, discusses the innovation and development of a ZK rollup fully secured by Bitcoin, highlighting a significant advancement in Bitcoin technology and rollup technology.\nKey Points of the Article:\n\n\nBackground and Evolution of Bitcoin and Rollups:\n\nThe article begins by referencing significant developments in Bitcoin, such as the implementation of soft forks like Segwit and Taproot, which expanded Bitcoin’s capacity for storing arbitrary data.\nThe emergence of Sovereign Rollups, a type of rollup that operates independently without relying on a settlement layer for its verification processes, is highlighted. This allows implementation on blockchains like Bitcoin, which don’t support smart contracts.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding ZK Rollups:\n\nZK (Zero Knowledge) rollups are a Layer 2 scaling solution that enhances blockchain transaction capacity by shifting transaction execution off-chain while maintaining crucial data on the main chain.\nThe article contrasts ZK rollups with Optimistic rollups, emphasizing ZK rollups’ use of validity proofs for transaction legitimacy, thus ensuring higher security and minimizing trust dependencies.\n\n\n\nZero-Knowledge Proofs - SNARKs and STARKs:\n\nZK rollups utilize zero-knowledge proofs (SNARKs or STARKs) for transaction verification.\nSNARKs, although earlier and widely adopted, have potential vulnerabilities and require a trusted setup. STARKs, in contrast, are resistant to quantum attacks and don’t require a trusted setup, making them a more secure choice.\n\n\n\nBitcoin’s Role in Securing ZK Rollups:\n\nThe article emphasizes Bitcoin’s robustness and reliability as a foundation for anchoring rollup transactions.\nTo inherit Bitcoin’s security features like liveness, re-org resistance, and censorship resistance without a soft fork, the article outlines Chainway’s approach that combines sovereign rollups, recursive ZK proofs, and a forced transaction mechanism.\n\n\n\nChainway’s Implementation Strategy:\n\nChainway ensures client-side validation fully inherits Bitcoin’s security by using recursive ZK proofs and a mechanism to check consecutive block headers, tying rollup proofs to Bitcoin headers.\nThe approach also addresses the issue of censorship resistance in rollups, ensuring that if sequencers attempt to censor transactions, users can still inscribe them directly to Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nConclusion and Vision:\n\nThe article concludes that it’s now possible to achieve a fully secured ZK rollup on Bitcoin without needing a soft fork, leveraging advancements in zero-knowledge proofs and Bitcoin’s Taproot update.\nChainway’s method aims to provide fast financial applications with low fees, secured by Bitcoin’s robust and reliable infrastructure.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the article provides an in-depth analysis of the development of a sovereign ZK rollup fully secured by Bitcoin, emphasizing the advancements in zero-knowledge proofs and the strategic use of Bitcoin’s security features to overcome the limitations of traditional rollup technology.",

        "username": "0x3639",
        "text": "Interesting Article shared to me by [@aliencoder](/u/aliencoder)\n\n\n\n[Medium – 30 Aug 23](https://medium.com/@chainway_xyz/open-sourcing-sovereign-sdk-da-adapter-data-availability-and-the-role-of-bitcoin-a4d503a2da74)\n\n\n\n[Open-sourcing Sovereign SDK DA Adapter: Data Availability and the Role of...](https://medium.com/@chainway_xyz/open-sourcing-sovereign-sdk-da-adapter-data-availability-and-the-role-of-bitcoin-a4d503a2da74)\nChainway is thrilled to announce a significant leap forward in building a sovereign rollup secured by Bitcoin and Zero Knowledge Proofs…\n\nReading time: 8 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a ChatGPT Summary:\nThe article “Open-sourcing Sovereign SDK DA Adapter: Data Availability and the Role of Bitcoin” by Chainway, published on August 30, 2023, discusses Chainway’s development of a sovereign rollup secured by Bitcoin and Zero Knowledge Proofs. They have recently open-sourced their Sovereign SDK Data Availability Adapter, which is crucial for leveraging Bitcoin as a data availability layer for Chainway’s rollup. The article explains the importance of data availability in blockchains and Layer 2 solutions and outlines why Bitcoin is an ideal data availability layer.\nKey Points of the Article:\n\n\nLayer 2 Solutions and Blockchain Trilemma: The article starts by explaining the need for Layer 2 solutions in blockchain technology. It discusses the Blockchain Trilemma, which involves balancing scalability, security, and decentralization. Layer 2 solutions like rollups are built on top of the main blockchain to enhance capabilities without compromising security.\n\n\nData Availability in Rollups: Data availability is crucial for rollups to function effectively. Rollups batch transactions and submit them to the main chain, but for disputing invalid transactions or ensuring the liveness of the rollup, access to data is necessary. The article distinguishes between Optimistic Rollups, which use fraud proofs, and ZK Rollups, which use validity proofs like ZK-SNARK/STARK.\n\n\nBitcoin as a Data Availability Layer: The article highlights Bitcoin’s strengths - its security, decentralization, and robust network - making it a strong platform for data availability. Bitcoin’s characteristics like liveness, censorship resistance, and reorg resistance make it suitable for securing rollups.\n\n\nChainway’s Sovereign SDK and DA Adapter: Chainway introduces the Sovereign SDK, a toolkit for building zk-rollups, and their open-source Data Availability Adapter. This adapter enables developers to utilize Bitcoin’s security for rollup solutions. It is designed to scan every block on the data availability layer, extract rollup data, generate proof of extracted data, and publish rollup data.\n\n\nOpen Source Philosophy: Chainway emphasizes the importance of open-sourcing their Data Availability Adapter. They aim to build a transparent, robust, and secure rollup with community involvement. Open sourcing allows for developer collaboration, promotes transparency, and accelerates the adoption of their solutions.\n\n\nConclusion and Future Vision: The article concludes by reiterating the importance of data availability in blockchains and the role of Bitcoin in ensuring the security and integrity of Layer 2 solutions like rollups. Bitcoin’s unparalleled security features are seen as key to the success of Chainway’s rollup.\n\n\nOverall, the article presents Chainway’s innovative approach to integrating Bitcoin’s robust architecture into Layer 2 solutions, particularly focusing on the importance of data availability and the role of their open-source Sovereign SDK Data Availability Adapter.",

It’s becoming clear this is becoming a distraction and especially for the devs who are most valuable.  The fact that [@vilkris](/u/vilkris) had to read through this and take time away from Dynamic Plasma is a huge mistake. \nSo let’s please stop the voting and let’s focus on building great stuff.  I have a new idea that will not waste any brain cells or create drama. \nI intend to continue writing the dev updates no matter what.\n  \n\n[](#proposal-2)Proposal\nWrite a community developer update every two months for the year 2024 and post them on zenon.info.  Here are samples of prior developer updates I have written.\n[December 2023](https://www.zenon.info/zenon-network-community-update-december-2023/)\n[August 2023](https://www.zenon.info/zenon-network-community-update-august-2023/)\n[July 2023](https://www.zenon.info/zenon-network-community-update-may-july-2023/)\n[April 2023](https://www.zenon.info/zenon-network-april-2023-community-update/)\n[March 2023](https://www.zenon.info/zenon-network-march-2023-community-update/)\n[February 2023](https://www.zenon.info/zenon-network-february-2023-community-update/)\n[January 2023](https://www.zenon.info/zenon-network-january-2023-update/)\nEach update takes me on average four hours to write PLUS the time I spend every day to be aware of all development activities.  In order to write these updates I’ve built the trust of the developers and they feel comfortable telling me what they are working on if I cannot see their work.  ChatGPT cannot write these updates and ChatGPT cannot earn the trust of a developer.  And we cannot hire a random technical writer online to do this work.  I don’t think anyone would talk to them.  I make every effort to write the dev section of the update myself with limited to no input from any developer.\nThe developer updates are used by the community to understand the status of the project and the developers themselves read them to learn what others are doing.  Some guys work silently by themselves and have no idea what others are doing.\nI cannot tell you the value of the posts nor should the AZ depend on the current or future value of the posts.  I am not proposing to integrate any funnels that track conversions, downloads of syrius, bridge events, or any performance metrics.  I can report the page views and I can track clicks on links, but I am proposing a simple Developer Update (per the 7 samples) that I know are useful to the community.  And, from what I can tell in Telegram, the community likes them.\nFor example, the Jan 2023 dev update received 473 views by 255 users and the average engagement was 2 minutes 27 seconds.  I can share these metrics for each post going forward, but the payout is not a function of their success.\nI’m asking to be compensated for my time to produce work that I think the community believes is useful, but the value is unknown. I’m also proposing no performance metrics on purpose because I do not believe ALL marketing can be measured on metrics alone.\nFor example, when Mr. Beast posted his [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XVcLrB7B3Y) do you think the metrics were good?  And if he simply relied on those metrics to determine the value of the work would he be the media giant he is today?  I believe you can create value over time with a sustained marketing effort, but the value is not readily apparent (initially).  I think the dev updates and many of the articles I post on .info fit into this category.  Check out how the grass roots marketing of kaspa evolved over time.  From what I can tell value creation is not a requirement for rewards.  There is some shitty marketing for sure, but when taken together they have a big footprint with some quality work with no VC funding.\nWhen we pumped the other day I had an article written for every question that came up in Telegram and anyone following at that time can attest to that.  I cannot tell you the value of that, but we had answers to questions.\n[](#funding-request-3)Funding Request\n100 znn per article for 6 articles = 600 znn paid out in two increments (month 6 and month 12).  Justification assumes 4 hours per article at $50USD per hour at $2/ZNN => (6)(4)(50)/2 = 600 znn\nI’m happy to share a portion of the funding with anyone who helps with artwork as others have in the past.\n[](#license-for-work-4)License For Work\nIf I receive reimbursement for the work, it will be licensed under this model.  I’ve added this license due to the insane conversation below.  This content is not intended to be monetized, funneled, ground up, repackaged, and linked all over the place in an effort to profit from it or get delegators.  It’s a simple dev update on what the community is doing that is shared on a neutral platform for the good of the project.\n[image948×612 40.7 KB](//hypercore.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/original/1X/1bfb32060f6c1d77ee6963f5f3e664250141936e.png)\n[](#community-support-5)Community Support\n\n\nYES I support this AZ\nNO I do not support this AZ\n\n\n\n\n\n0\nvoters\n\n\n\n",

It’s clear your proposal has two intentions: attempt to develop a precedent for marketing that’s purposely unmeasured, while masking the ill-intent motives with your reputation as a contributor and work you’ve produced. You should’ve had labeled this as an operational expense for the network IMO. But you’re labelling it as marketing to discredit the need for performance for future (poor) AZ’s in the marketing category. Marketing will always require proof. Operations, to a lesser extent than marketing.\nI agree on the vote for your contributions (yes to pay you), I disagree with the way you’ve once again misformulated the proposal (this is your 2nd shot in a row at Attribute and performance tech benefits for the network, you did the same with the last one re: thesis with your first poll, this time you kept Attribute keywords out of the equation).\nSilly and scrappy as usual. Had to call you out.\nGoing forward dev updates if paid by AZ (hopefully they will), will be reposted on Org and used alongside performance systems to prove new value generated to the network. I believe I’ve offered many opportunities for collaboration/guidance on best practices, but enough is enough. I’ll build the evidence with contributors I don’t have to argue-with anymore. There’s a bunch who believe in the vision and needs for evidence-based marketing, especially when it comes to articles. I do agree that some marketing forms may have a bit more difficulty with Attribute-included campaigns, but articles are the prime channels for performance strategies. You don’t want to include for the sake of trying to make a weak point. I’m making mine now.",

        "text": "0x provided some responses already.\nWhy a per momentum cap?\nNetwork growth needs to be bounded to ensure accessibility of full nodes / decentralization. Plasma is a measure of computational resource utilization. A consistent load is efficient and ensures nodes won’t crash. Technology improves over time so we probably can account for that by making the cap subject to governance. Long term some sort of benchmark oracle to target a certain level of consumer hardware.\nThe plasma cap already exists. Your account gets plasma based on QSR fused. Fusing anymore than 5000 QSR doesn’t do anything. All of the plasma associated with a tx is returned once the tx is confirmed.\nSentinels have been described as the public backbone of the network creating pow links and acting as oracles. Sentinels creating pow links have been described since the whitepaper. Incentivizing pow links incentivizes running a public node which is necessary for tx relay and IBD. It requires some thought to understand why.\nRequiring the first tx be a receive on any account chain is not a good idea. Privacy is a big part of the appeal of PoW. Single use addresses have a role. And getting initial funds from an embedded contract, e.g htlc/ptlc require a contract send to start.\nWho/what is going to set the pow → plasma rate?\nA centralized admin?

        "text": "I have been contemplating an idea. It’s a very simple concept, essentially a mobile wallet that is streamlined.\nI have seen the Figma design for the Sirius mobile app, and it’s beautiful. I look forward to using it. However, I believe that Sirius might be overwhelming for new users as it introduces too many concepts that are irrelevant to most users.\nI propose a basic wallet called “Gravity.”\nThe focus and narrative around Gravity are straightforward. It strips away all the complexities of the Network of Momentum. The message of the Gravity wallet is zero transaction fees for tokens with an emphasis on fiat-backed stablecoins.\nThe wallet will be very simple, and the design should be neutral but elegant. The main screen will have an account overview and a token list. Users will have the ability to send and receive funds, made easy with QR codes and an address book. That’s it—very simple.\nThere is only one thing the user needs to learn about this wallet: there are two states, the default Gravity state and the Zero Gravity state. When the Gravity wallet holds a QSR balance, it turns into Zero Gravity. Behind the scenes, the wallet automatically fuses QSR; the user doesn’t need to do anything. When the wallet is in Zero Gravity, the UI changes, is lifted, and the logo transforms.\nThe marketing and communication to new users are simple: Buy QSR and keep it in the wallet for Zero Gravity.\nThe initial market for this could be people in countries like Turkey, Venezuela, Argentina, Nigeria, etc., who transact a lot in stablecoins via EVM chains and tend towards those with the lowest fees. Ultimately, the target audience for this app is literally everybody in the world.\nAn appealing narrative could be the free and uncensorable nature of the wallet. I want the user to be able to download the app, open it, and be in it immediately. Unlike Metamask, where a user downloads the app and is greeted with terms of service agreements. Gravity has no terms of service, it provides egalitarian, free, and uncensorable access to the network.\nWhat are some drawbacks or pain points of this idea?\n\nThere are currently no stablecoins on the Network of Momentum, and bridged EVM coins provide a poor user experience. If users can’t buy ZTS stablecoins on exchanges and send them to their Gravity wallet via an address or QR code, then this wallet will struggle to find users.\nA QSR market. The point here is nearly the same as with the previous one. The user needs to be able to easily get QSR into their wallet.\nA embedded node. It would be most ideal if the app runs a light node that syncs with the zk proof in a matter of seconds. Connecting to public nodes will add a layer of complexity that this app is trying to remove.\n\nI’m under a time constraint at the moment, so I’m not sure if I did a good job putting the idea to paper. But that is the basic idea of the Gravity wallet. Let me know what you guys think of it. Any ideas are welcome.",

Rather than try to make the existing hardcore wallet super simple and noob-friendly, simply have a separate light wallet which is easy for mass-appeal/mass-use. Those actually interested can find the hardcore wallet and follow guides/ask Qs.\nOn Zenocratez account I shared some alternative designs for SYRIUS to consolidate functionality onto the main tab/dashboard, which I still think should be done, but maybe SYRIUS can have a light wallet equivalent too. One which is just for delegating and staking, but doesn’t have any pillar/sentinel/zts creation stuff for example.",

Even though it’s really cool, I think it’s too hard for mass-appeal.\nIn my work I meet a dozen or more people every day in an intimate setting, so I feel I know first-hand how simple you need to make things such that the majority of people will understand intuitively.\nAn alternative?\nCall it a Q-name to make people realise you need QSR. Make a display of a QSR tank similar to a fuel tank, where it’s red, empty and unhappy with no QSR, but with QSR it becomes green, full and happy (and automatically fused). A “QSR tank” rather than the zero-gravity thing. Wallet could literally be called the Q Wallet.\nFor the record – your idea is way cooler. My suggestion is just to dumb things down significantly, as people already understand fuel tanks and your target is the whole world? My 2 cents",

It’s challenging to explain to somebody that they can make a free transaction, but their device will need to perform a POW calculation.\nHowever, to say ‘yes, it’s free, but there is a gravity to this transaction’, makes it more tangible. It is heavy; it may take longer and use more battery. Put QSR in the wallet, and the transaction becomes lighter and moves with zero gravity.\nThis is easy to understand and makes sense to people as they have an intuitive understanding that nothing is free, and they come to reconcile this understanding without the need for explaining proof of work, plasma, and all that jargon that goes along with crypto.\nUltimately, it comes down to testing and seeing how POW works on a phone. This really depends on how Phase 1 is implemented and what the performance metrics are.",

        "text": "Good (and simple) video that describes the CAP Theorem.\n\n[\n\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHqjEjzAicA)\n\n[](#background-1)Background\nThe theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:\n\nConsistency: Every read receives the most recent write or an error. This means that all nodes see the same data at the same time.\nAvailability: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write. This means the system is always up and running, and every request gets a response, but the response might not be the most up-to-date.\nPartition Tolerance: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes. In other words, the system can continue to operate even if there is a “partition” (a communication breakdown) between two nodes caused by network failure.\n\nAccording to the CAP theorem, a distributed system can only provide two of these three guarantees at the same time, not all three. For example, if a system prioritizes consistency and partition tolerance, it might not be able to maintain availability, leading to system downtime during network partitions.\nThis theorem is a central concept in distributed computing and has significant implications for the design of distributed databases, distributed file systems, and other similar technologies. It helps system designers to understand the trade-offs between different system properties and to make informed decisions about their architecture.\n[Source: ChatGPT]",

        "text": "Inspired by the discussion for dynamic Plasma, I’m coming up with a brand new development that seeks to decentralize the mining pools found in Bitcoin.\nEvery use in NoM can act like a “solo-miner” and use PoW to generate Plasma and issue feeless transactions.\nI’m thinking out loud now: is it possible to recycle this PoW and mine actual Bitcoin?\nI’ve come across [Braidpool](https://blog.opdup.com/2021/06/30/can-braidpool-reuse-p2pool-components.html), a new concept that seems to check all the boxes:\n\n\nA peer to peer network of miners to disseminate shares:\nWe already have a p2p network of “miners”: they are the users of NoM.\n\n\nA rewards calculation algorithm that incentivizes miners to disseminate them at the earliest.\nVery interesting because we already have this mechanism: you want your transaction to be issued as soon as possible.\n\n\nPayment channels to make payouts to miners so that a constant amount of blockspace is required, independent of the number of participating miners.\nHere’s where PTLCs come into play.\n\n\nAn anonymous hub that can’t deny rewards payouts to miners.\nCan Pillars be those anonymous hubs? They already issue payouts for hundreds of delegators.\n\n\n\nIn P2Pool the network difficulty is adjusted so that the pool finds one share every 30 seconds. This results in smaller miners struggling to find enough share and makes P2Pool economically nonviable for them. In Braidpool, this is not the case. Each miner participating in Braidpool can choose the difficulty they mine at so that they generate a share at an interval of their choosing. Small miners will mine at low difficulty to generate a share every 10 seconds, while large miners will mine at a much larger difficulty to find a share every 10 seconds. Both the difficulty and the share period can be configured by the miner.\n\nI’m remembering some parts of the whitepaper that compares Pillars to mining pools. Is the whitepaper so forward thinking? The more I read, the more interesting those ideas become… I’m trying to connect some dots here.\nWe should definitely explore this subject.",

Can that also be P2P? Or does it need to be more like a traditional mining pool, as the 3rd party miners need to trust the pillar which has control over rewards distribution and fees charged, and if the pillar goes down the mining stops? Why would 3rd party miners enter into a traditional mining pool with pillars if the future is P2P, is it cos they are incentivised by mergemined ZNN rewards too, is that the tradeoff?\nAnd you say regular non-pillar ZNNAliens can have their PoW for transactions recycled, do they get rewarded in proportion to their hash contribution too, are they considered part of the pillar’s pool? Is that where the Braid implementation comes in, because it’s friendly to small miners? Doesn’t Braidpool have a minimum difficulty level though, so people below the threshold won’t be able to generate any shares? I guess their reward is they get to have a feeless transaction, regardless of any BTC reward … and the recycled PoW is a public good which indirectly benefits them because it benefits zenon overall",

This is important because small miners can offset their costs by generating ZNN, while benefiting from the price exposure (larger miners with more hashpower are generating BTC for the network as a whole).\nFurthermore, the BTC that will get mined is a collective good of the network (that will be used for other network operations aka paying for block space), increasing the overall value of the network. Pillars can reuse this PoW and “anchor” it into the ledger: “strengthen the ledger by adding weight into it (i.e. recording the resulting work of the PoW link”.\n\n\n\n Zyler:\n\nWhy would 3rd party miners enter into a traditional mining pool with pillars if the future is P2P, is it cos they are incentivised by mergemined ZNN rewards too, is that the tradeoff?\n\n\nThe mining will be done peer-to-peer: Pillars will only do “[miner share accounting](https://blog.opdup.com/specifications/BlockGeneration.pdf)”, but with ZNN instead of BTC. The resulting BTC will go into the network’s “treasury”.\n\n\n\n Zyler:\n\nDoesn’t Braidpool have a minimum difficulty level though, so people below the threshold won’t be able to generate any shares?\n\n\n“Since [small miners](https://blog.opdup.com/2021/06/30/can-braidpool-reuse-p2pool-components.html) are able to find shares at their chosen difficultly, they can claim rewards for all their PoW shares.”\n\n\n\n Chadass:\n\nTrustless mining pool.\n\n\nExactly this is the objective.

The emergence of altcoins was driven by a desire to either rival or enhance Bitcoin’s perceived limitations. These altcoins sought improvements in various domains:\n\nProgrammability: Implementing Turing-complete smart contracts for enhanced functionality.\nSecurity: Developing innovative consensus protocols for robust network protection.\nSpeed: Utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques for faster transaction processing.\n\nIn contrast, Zenon Network, the Network of Momentum (NoM), is designed not to compete with Bitcoin but to improve its capabilities by leveraging the strengths of both networks.\nSince its inception, Bitcoin has seen many altcoins come and go. Among these, Ethereum stands out as a prominent cryptocurrency. However, Ethereum has made significant trade-offs, such as the shift to a proof-of-stake model. This shift has sparked concerns about Ethereum’s long-term stability.\nIn this evolving landscape, the Network of Momentum (NoM) sets itself apart by aiming to enhance Bitcoin rather than compete against it. NoM is uniquely positioned as the first decentralized network to:\n\nTrustless Bitcoin Acquisition: Utilize merge-mining to acquire Bitcoin in a secure, trustless manner.\nTrustless Bitcoin Control: Employ advanced methods like Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) and 3. Stake-Based Threshold Multi-Signatures (STM) for decentralized Bitcoin custody.\nProgrammability Enhancement: Integrate zero-knowledge rollups to improve Bitcoin’s programmability, using tapscripts for on-chain proof embedding.\nSecurity Synergy: Leverage the robust security of Bitcoin to underpin NoM’s own consensus protocol.\n\nCrucially, NoM advocates for the growth of decentralized, peer-to-peer Bitcoin mining pools, essential for the diversification of Bitcoin’s hashpower. This vision includes a symbiotic relationship with Bitcoin, contributing hashpower in return for block space. This block space is instrumental in securing highly scalable zk-rollups on Bitcoin, marking a significant step forward in blockchain interoperability and efficiency.\n[](#architecture-and-design-of-the-network-of-momentum-3)Architecture and Design of the Network of Momentum\nNoM features a distinctive dual-ledger system, comprising a meta-DAG for executing the consensus protocol and a block-lattice for transaction settlements. Utilizing Ed25519, a fast and secure deterministic signature scheme based on Curve25519, NoM ensures cryptographic robustness.\nThe block-lattice structure, composed of individual account-chains holding transactional data identified by public addresses, introduces a novel transaction mechanism with send-blocks and receive-blocks, marking transaction completion upon the send-block’s publication.\nNoM’s development is phased. Phase 0 introduced Plasma, a fee abstraction mechanism allowing users to generate proof-of-work or lock QSR to process transactions. Phase 1, currently under design and development, will introduce dynamic plasma which removes the artificial cap on the transaction-per-second throughput (TPS). In addition, the network can incorporate a fee-based mechanism, akin to Ethereum’s EIP-1559.\nIn Phase I transactions will be probabilistic, as they will be anchored on Bitcoin’s blockchain. The block-lattice ledger will gain additional weight as it accumulates proof-of-work from both transactions and miners.\nEach account-chain stores account-blocks that are layered one on top of another in a similar way to which blocks within a blockchain are linked to each other. This is an important aspect for the merge-mining process that requires a dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism. The mining difficulty will be automatically adjusted by implementing a dynamic difficulty targeting algorithm for the merge-mining account-chain.\nEmbedded contracts at the protocol level are the foundation of NoM. For instance, the Pillar embedded contract, which also has its own account-chain, oversees network emissions for Pillars and their delegators.\nPillars represent the consensus nodes in NoM. Delegators stake ZNN to Pillars and are ordered by their total delegated stake. The top 30 Pillars produce more momentums per epoch. Pillars can adjust how much they want to share from their rewards with their delegators at the end of each epoch. The distribution of ZNN is handled automatically by the embedded contract and it represents the blueprint for the mining embedded contract.\nTo enable BTC and ZNN merge-mining, an on-chain network upgrade mechanism (spork) will deploy a specialized merge-mining embedded contract called the “share-chain”. This necessitates Pillars and Sentinels to run Bitcoin full nodes, ensuring connection and block propagation within the Bitcoin network. Miners in NoM can join the network via Zenon full nodes ([znnd](https://github.com/zenon-network/go-zenon)) and participate in the construction of the share-chain, a blockchain-like structure within the embedded account-chain.\nThe share-chain will operate at a lower difficulty than Bitcoin’s mainchain. The share-chain allows pool miners to collaborate in a decentralized pool by mining shares on the share chain at a rate of one share block every 10 seconds. Each of the blocks on the share chain records a proportionate share reward for the pool miners who contribute work, carrying the shares forward from the previous share block. When one of the share blocks also achieves the Bitcoin difficulty target, Pillars broadcast these valid blocks to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network using bitcoind full node. Upon acceptance, the newly mined BTC from these transactions are deposited into a Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) vault, controlled by the Pillars. Miners who contribute to the share-chain receive ZNN as a reward. This mined BTC is allocated for purchasing block space, facilitating the development of smart contract applications, details of which will be discussed later.\nIn Phase I NoM will incorporate advanced cryptographic techniques, like [FROST](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost) (Flexible Round Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures) with a [ROAST wrapper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550.pdf), for decentralized BTC custody, and we are exploring [Mithril](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/916.pdf), a stake-based threshold multisignature scheme, to enhance network governance with a veto like process.\nUltimately, NoM aspires to be a decentralized network that not only coordinates BTC and ZNN merge-mining but also fortifies Bitcoin’s censorship-resistant properties.\n[](#bitcoin-fractal-scaling-with-zk-rollups-4)Bitcoin Fractal Scaling with zk-Rollups\nBy utilizing BTC as a Data Availability layer, NoM will be able to incorporate zk-rollup data into Bitcoin blocks mined in order to bypass transaction censorship typically seen in centralized mining pools.\nExample of a typical zk-Rollup architecture:\n\n\nL1 Smart Contract Management of L2:\n\nEnables deposits and withdrawals.\nPublishes new state roots (“assertions”).\nPublishes compressed transaction data batches for verification.\n\n\n\nL2 Operators (also called Validators/Aggregators/Sequencers):\n\nBatch transactions, forming the basis of the rollup.\n\n\n\nZero-knowledge rollups, a Layer 2 scaling solution, use zero-knowledge proof systems to enhance blockchain throughput and computing capabilities. These rollups have distinct advantages:\n\nSecurity and Integrity: Validators can’t corrupt the state or misappropriate funds.\nUser Protection: In case validators act dishonestly, users can withdraw funds en masse.\nFraud Prevention: Unlike optimistic rollups, continuous monitoring of blocks isn’t needed.\n\nZk-rollups inherit the security guarantees of the underlying Layer 1, significantly enhancing scalability and transaction capabilities. In this architecture, a prover submits a “validity proof” (often using ZK-SNARKs or ZK-STARKs) of transaction batches. This proof is easier to verify than redoing the entire computation.\nThe smart contract on the Layer 1 validates these proofs despite limited computational ability. State transitions in zk-rollups are determined by applying a deterministic function which defines the rollup as a sequence of state transition steps, starting from a known initial state, similar to how blockchains start from a genesis block. This sequence is represented as a sequence of blocks, where each block consists of an ordered list of transactions. Validity proofs ensure correctness of off-chain transactions and prevent operators from executing invalid state transitions.\nThus, the security of zk-rollups is provided by the underlying blockchain. The underlying L1 enforces the correctness of every update on the zk-rollup’s state and attests that the data that describes these updates is available. Another throughput enhancement technique is recursive proofs, where multiple block proofs are aggregated into one final proof, enabling the finalization of several blocks simultaneously.\n[](#zk-rollups-on-nom-with-btc-security-5)ZK Rollups on NoM with BTC Security\nThe goal is to achieve a trustless ZK-rollup solution that leverages Bitcoin’s security and decentralization for data availability while leveraging NoM’s computing, consensus and merge-mining layers to enhance the programmability and overall censorship resistance property of the rollup. NoM will post data proofs needed to recover the off-chain state on Bitcoin, which guarantees security, censorship-resistance, and decentralization. But due to the limited computing capabilities of Bitcoin, automatic user withdrawals are not possible. However, the embedded contract on NoM can verify the proofs on the Bitcoin network with its own data and can perform the required computations.\nTransactions specific to the zk-rollup will be processed off-chain by special NoM nodes called executors that collect, process, and compile batches of transactions into a rollup. Once transactions are batched, executors will generate a zero-knowledge proof confirming the validity of all transactions in the batch. Rollup blocks will be published in the embedded contract and then inscribed onto the Bitcoin blockchain by leveraging Taproot techniques.\nOrdinals inscribe data into the witness part of a Bitcoin transaction, and NoM will use a similar technique to embedded the rollup date into the witness part of a transaction. A standard Taproot transaction can include up to around 400KB of data in order to pass through the public mempool. By leveraging merge-mining, NoM is able to completely bypass the public mempool and create a non-standard coinbase transaction that can embed up to 4MB of arbitrary data into the blockchain. Merge-mining will make NoM immune to any form of censorship and enable it to store zk-rollup proofs in a way that is strictly tied to Bitcoin’s security model.\nThe rollup will benefit from Bitcoin’s security (re-organization-resistance, censorship-resistance) and decentralization and users will be always able to unilaterally withdraw their funds without the cooperation of executor nodes by posting the corresponding proofs to NoM’s embedded contract.\nIn order to further enhance the operation of the zk-rollup, a security bond will be required for running executor nodes, similar to zk-sync’s [instant confirmations proposal](https://docs.zksync.io/userdocs/tech/#instant-confirmations).\nAnother interesting topic of discussion is embedding the zk-circuits into the Bitcoin blockchain using the [pay-to-contract output](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/pay-to-contract-outputs/).",

Seems to work as expected.\n[@sumamu](/u/sumamu) have you tested this and do you think there is any reason we should not do that?\nI really think over time we might consider migrating the Orchestrator to a kubernetes cluster that sets up the binary and nodes for each network.  If we add more networks we need to be running nodes ourselves IMO.\n\nHelios is a fully trustless, efficient, and portable Ethereum light client written in Rust.\nHelios converts an untrusted centralized RPC endpoint into a safe unmanipulable local RPC for its users. It syncs in seconds, requires no storage, and is lightweight enough to run on mobile devices.\nThe entire size of Helios’s binary is 5.3Mb and should be easy to compile into WebAssembly. This makes it a perfect target to embed directly inside wallets and dapps.\n",

        "text": "I’m posting this after seeing quite a lot of seed / private rounds for low quality projects pretending to solve the BRC20 UX by providing an Uniswap-like experience to users. Most of them are straight out not working and the few that actually works are half CEXs as all the logic happens offchain.\nGiven the BRC20 structure - Ordinals + centralized indexers - I was wondering if this could be useful and interesting: Move the AMM on the ext-chain (or NoM) and do the settlement on BTC. This means we can move Instriptions from Bitcoin to our chain or abstract away that part so it’s transparent for the user. Does this make sense? I mean, there’s an obvious issue here so maybe we can solve it and leverage this to step into the BTC nascent ecosystem. Foor for thoughts.",

        "username": "0x3639",
        "text": "Let’s setup Monit to monitor /var/log/syslog to ensure your Pillar is producing momentums.  We do that by using Monit to check if a certain value (“Height”) in the syslog is incrementing with each check. We use a custom script that Monit can execute. Monit itself does not have built-in functionality for parsing specific values within log files, but it can easily trigger scripts based on certain conditions.\nHere’s a step-by-step guide on how you can set this up:\n[](#step-1-write-a-script-to-check-the-log-file-1)Step 1: Write a Script to Check the Log File\nCreate a script to monitor the /var/log/syslog for specific changes.\n\nScript Content:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nLOG_FILE=\"/var/log/syslog\"\nLAST_HEIGHT_FILE=\"/path/to/last_height.txt\"\nSEARCH_PATTERN=\"\\[Momentum inserted\\] Height:\"\n\n# Extract the latest height value from the log file\nlatest_height=$(grep \"$SEARCH_PATTERN\" \"$LOG_FILE\" | tail -1 | awk -F'Height: ' '{print $2}' | awk -F', ' '{print $1}')\n\n# Debug: Print the latest height\necho \"Latest height extracted: $latest_height\"\n\n# Read the last height value stored\nlast_height=$(cat \"$LAST_HEIGHT_FILE\" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)\n\n# Compare and update\nif [ -z \"$latest_height\" ]; then\n    echo \"Pattern not found\"\n    exit 1\nelif [ \"$latest_height\" -le \"$last_height\" ]; then\n    echo \"Height not incrementing\"\n    exit 1\nelse\n    echo \"$latest_height\" > \"$LAST_HEIGHT_FILE\"\n    exit 0\nfi\n\n\n\nMake the Script Executable:\n\nchmod +x /path/to/your/script.sh\n\n[](#step-2-configure-monit-to-use-the-script-2)Step 2: Configure Monit to Use the Script\nFollow these steps to configure Monit:\n\nLocate or Create a Monit Configuration File:\n\n\nEdit the main configuration file: /etc/monit/monitrc\nOr, create a new file in /etc/monit/conf.d/, like logcheck.conf.\n\n\nAdd the Service Entry with Interval: Add the following to your configuration file, including the interval directive:\n\ncheck program check_height with path \"/path/to/your/script.sh\"\n    every 2 cycles\n    if status != 0 then alert\n\n\nThis example sets Monit to run the script every 2 cycles. If your Monit is configured to check every minute, this means the script will be run every 2 minutes.\n\n\nSave and Exit the Configuration File.\nCheck Monit Configuration for Syntax Errors:\n\nsudo monit -t\n\n\nReload or Restart Monit:\n\nsudo monit reload\n\nor\nsudo service monit restart\n\n[](#step-3-configure-email-alerts-in-monit-3)Step 3: Configure Email Alerts in Monit\n[](#h-1-edit-the-monit-configuration-file-4)1. Edit the Monit Configuration File\n\nOpen the main Monit configuration file, typically located at /etc/monit/monitrc:\n\nsudo nano /etc/monit/monitrc\n\n[](#h-2-configure-mail-server-settings-5)2. Configure Mail Server Settings\n\nLocate or add a section in the configuration file for setting up the mail server. Here’s an example using Gmail’s SMTP server:\n\nset mailserver smtp.gmail.com port 587\n    username \"your.email@gmail.com\" password \"yourpassword\"\n    using tlsv1\n    with timeout 30 seconds\n\n\nReplace your.email@gmail.com and yourpassword with your actual Gmail email address and password. If you’re using two-factor authentication with Gmail, you’ll need to generate an app-specific password.\nIf you’re using a different email provider, you’ll need to use their specific SMTP server settings.\n\n[](#h-3-set-the-alert-recipient-6)3. Set the Alert Recipient\n\nDefine whom Monit should send the email alerts to:\n\nset alert your.email@example.com\n\n\nReplace your.email@example.com with the email address where you want to receive the alerts.\n\n[](#h-4-customize-email-format-optional-7)4. Customize Email Format (Optional)\n\nYou can customize the email format for alerts. For example:\n\nset mail-format {\n    from: monit@yourdomain.com\n    subject: Monit Alert -- $EVENT $SERVICE\n    message: Monit $ACTION $SERVICE at $DATE on $HOST: $DESCRIPTION.\n}\n\n\nAdjust the from, subject, and message fields as needed.\n\n[](#h-5-save-and-close-the-configuration-file-8)5. Save and Close the Configuration File\n\nAfter making these changes, save and close the file.\n\n[](#h-6-test-the-email-setup-9)6. Test the Email Setup\n\nTo ensure that the email setup works, you can force Monit to send a test alert:\n\nsudo monit reload\nsudo monit status\n\n\nThis reloads Monit with the new configuration and the status command can help in confirming if Monit is running correctly.\n\n[](#h-7-reload-or-restart-monit-10)7. Reload or Restart Monit\n\nApply your changes by reloading or restarting Monit:\n\nsudo monit reload\n\nor\nsudo service monit restart\n\n[](#additional-monitoring-11)Additional Monitoring\n[](#system-health-12)System Health\nMonitor and alert system health.\nsudo nano /etc/monit/conf.d/system_monitor.conf\ncheck device root with path /dev/sda3\n    if SPACE usage > 80% for 2 cycles then alert\n\ncheck system $HOST\n    if loadavg (1min) per core > 2 for 5 cycles then alert\n    if loadavg (5min) per core > 1.5 for 10 cycles then alert\n    if cpu usage > 80% for 10 cycles then alert\n    if memory usage > 75% then alert\n    if swap usage > 25% then alert\n\n[](#network-usage-13)Network Usage\nMonitor and alert network usage.\nsudo nano /etc/monit/conf.d/network_usage.conf\n## Check a network link status (up/down), link capacity changes, saturation\n## and bandwidth usage.\n#\n  check network public with interface eth0\n    if failed link then alert\n    if changed link then alert\n    if saturation > 90% then alert\n    if download > 10 MB/s then alert\n    if total uploaded > 1 GB in last hour then alert\n\n[](#orchestrator-messages-14)Orchestrator Messages\nMonitor Orchestrator messages for potential errors\nsudo nano /etc/monit/conf.d/orchestrator_logs.conf\ncheck file syslog with path /var/log/syslog\n    if match \"KeyGen threshold was not met\" then alert\n    if match \"orchestrator successfully started\" then alert\n    if match \"websocket: close 1006 (abnormal closure): unexpected EOF\" then alert\n    if match \"websocket: close 1001 (going away): upstream went away\" then alert\n    if match \"Stopping orchestrator\" then alert\n    if match \"Started ECDSA Keygen\" then alert\n    if match \"error signing unwrap\" then alert\n\n[](#notes-15)Notes:\n\nEnsure the script has read permissions for /var/log/syslog.\nAdjust the script as needed for your log file format.\nConfigure Monit with your email settings in monitrc for alerts.\nCheck /var/log/monit.log for logs and troubleshooting.\nSecurity Considerations: Storing plain text passwords in configuration files is not recommended for security reasons. Consider using environment variables or other secure methods to store sensitive information.\nUsing a Different Email Provider: If you’re using a different email provider (other than Gmail), you’ll need to use their SMTP server settings. Make sure to use the correct server address, port, and encryption method.\nSpam Filters: Sometimes, automated alert emails may be flagged as spam. Ensure that your email is configured to allow these messages to reach your inbox.\n",

Here’s a step-by-step guide:\n\n\nCheck Current Limits:\nFirst, check the current limits for your system. Open a terminal and use the following command:\nulimit -n\n\nThis will show you the current limit on open files for the current user session.\n\n\nTemporary Increase:\nTo temporarily increase the limit for the current session, use:\nulimit -n [new limit]\n\nReplace [new limit] with the desired number, like 65536.\n\n\nPermanent Increase:\nFor a permanent change, you need to edit system configuration files:\n\n\nEdit Limits Configuration:\nOpen the /etc/security/limits.conf file with a text editor (as root or using sudo), and add the following lines:\nsoft nofile 1024\nhard nofile 65536\n\nReplace [soft limit] and [hard limit] with the desired values. The soft limit is the default number of open files, while the hard limit is the maximum number that can be set using ulimit -n.\n\n\nFor go-zenon Service:\nEdit /etc/systemd/system/go-zenon.service:\n[Service]\nLimitNOFILE=65536\n\n\n\n\n\nApply Changes:\n\nAfter editing the limits.conf file, save it and reboot your system for the changes to take effect.\nIf you’ve modified a systemd service file, reload the systemd configuration with sudo systemctl daemon-reload, and then restart the service.\n\n\n\nVerify Changes:\nAfter rebooting or restarting the service, verify that the changes have been applied by using the ulimit -n command again.\n\n\nRemember, setting these limits too high can affect system stability, so it’s important to choose a value that balances your needs with the capabilities of your system.\n[](#increase-the-amount-of-swap-memory-2)Increase the amount of swap memory\nTo set up a system for dynamically increasing swap space on Linux, you can use a tool like dphys-swapfile. This tool is commonly used in Debian-based systems, such as Ubuntu, to manage a dynamic swap file. Here are the general steps to set it up:\n[](#installing-dphys-swapfile-3)Installing dphys-swapfile\n\n\nUpdate Your Package Lists:\nOpen a terminal and update your package lists to ensure you get the latest version of the software:\nsudo apt update\n\n\n\nInstall dphys-swapfile:\nInstall the dphys-swapfile package:\nsudo apt install dphys-swapfile\n\n\n\n[](#configuring-dphys-swapfile-4)Configuring dphys-swapfile\n\n\nEdit the Configuration File:\nOpen the configuration file in a text editor. For example, using nano:\nsudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile\n\n\n\nConfigure Swap Settings:\nIn the configuration file, you can set parameters like the size of the swap file. For instance:\n\nTo set the swap file size to 8GB:CONF_SWAPSIZE=8196\n\n\nTo make the swap file size dynamic based on available RAM, you can comment out the CONF_SWAPSIZE line by adding a # at the beginning.\n\n\n\nSave and Exit:\nAfter making your changes, save and exit the editor. In nano, this is done by pressing CTRL+X, then Y to confirm, and Enter to save.\n\n\n[](#activating-the-swap-file-5)Activating the Swap File\n\n\nRestart the dphys-swapfile Service:\nApply the changes by restarting the service:\nsudo systemctl restart dphys-swapfile\n\n\n\nVerify Swap File Creation:\nCheck that the swap is active:\nswapon --show\n\nThis command will display the active swap files and partitions. Your newly created swap file should be listed.\n\n\n[](#reduce-the-number-of-peers-in-configjson-6)Reduce the number of peers in config.json\nsudo nano /root/.znn/config.json\n{\n    \"Producer\": {\n        \"Index\": 0,\n        \"KeyFilePath\": \"producer\",\n        \"Password\": \"REDUCE\",\n        \"Address\": \"REDUCE\"\n    },\n    \"Net\": {\n        \"MinPeers\": 8,\n        \"MinConnectedPeers\": 8,\n        \"MaxPeers\": 16,\n        \"MaxPendingPeers\": 32\n    }\n}\n\n[](#additional-notes-7)Additional Notes\n\nAutomatic Management: dphys-swapfile will automatically manage the swap file, creating it at boot time and removing it at shutdown.\nPerformance Considerations: Keep in mind that using swap space can impact system performance, especially if the swap file is used heavily.\nSystem Requirements: Make sure your system has enough disk space for the swap file, especially if you’re setting a large fixed size.\n\nThis setup provides a basic dynamic swap configuration. For more advanced configurations, refer to the dphys-swapfile documentation and your Linux distribution’s specific guidelines.",

        "text": "There is clearly a demand for public nodes and not enough supply. Those service providers bear the costs of bandwidth, compute, and resource management.\nAt least, the current set of operators capable of supplying the service aren’t jumping at the opportunity to be altruistic.\nIn my situation, it would cost me an additional ~$25/month to host a public node, but I’m not receiving any sort of compensation.\n\nToday, I propose an incentive model that introduces a new dynamic in our current delegation order. Those who embrace this incentive will likely rise to the top 30 pillars while the others could lose weight, especially as we onboard new aliens in the ecosystem.\nI’ve PoC’d* a websocket proxy in Golang that can intercept Zenon client RPC requests and selectively return data based on any criteria. Service providers can choose which RPC calls they want to allow or deny.\nExamples of aforementioned criteria:\n\nReturn data only for addresses that have delegated X amount to a specific pillar for Y days\nReturn data based on an arbitrary allow-list\n\nonly for your small Discord community\nonly paying subscribers\nonly orchestrators or other node operators can use it\n\n\nDrop data based on request type or source address\n\nWe can productize this solution to simplify the criteria selection process for less technical pillars.\nThey can reduce the rewards they share in order to offset the cost for this service.\nFor example, if a non-delegator makes a request to query their account balance in Syrius, they will see a spinning wheel. Only delegators would have unrestricted access to all RPC calls.\nPillars can get creative with their offerings.\nNon-pillars could potentially adopt this by finding other ways to receive compensation for their service.\nEventually, we could have a page like [this one](https://publicnodes.somenano.com/), displaying node capabilities, current status, etc.\n* the PoC is rough but could be worth pursuing if the community supports the idea.\n\n\ninb4 Trust. Don’t Verify.\n\nUntil we have a process to validate which nodes are acting honestly, the community will have to trust the nodes they connect to. Given pillars are incentivized to maintain a good relationship with their delegators, they will likely provide truthful data.\nWe can also work towards the goal of node validation. There are some objective sources of truth that we can leverage, minimizing the amount of trust required to use them. Eventually, we’ll solve this problem too.\n\nSome scenarios\n\nService providers bear all the costs\n\nNot scalable – little participation to date\nNot sustainable for anyone that isn’t generating income for this service\n\n\nPublic nodes are subsidized by AZ\n\nNot scalable to many service providers\nMay not be sustainable or a good use of funds\n\n\nFreemium model\n\nA subset of functionality is free or rate-limited\nCriteria is defined for “paying” subscribers\n\nThese could be delegators\n\n\nPremium access is less/not limited\n\n\nPublic nodes as a premium service\n\nPrivately-funded, dedicated infrastructure for subscribers\nScalable and sustainable\n\n\n",

        "text": "Objective: Deliver Network of Momentum Phase 1\nOur current objective is to transition to NoM Phase 1. We have a basic list of things we need to do in order to successfully deliver Phase 1. I’m here to expand this list and provide some missing pieces of the puzzle.\nMissing links\n\nNetwork incentives\nPeer-to-peer layer\nPoW links\nDynamic Plasma\n\nI’ve started this list with the network incentives point because it is the backbone of a decentralized network. This is the reason why Bitcoin still exists today and will exist in the future as well. I’ll be quoting the original whitepaper to support my views. I’ll use the whitepaper as a reference point and adapt it to our current realities.\n\n“In order for the network to function properly, a cryptoeconomic layer will be put in place for all network participants.”\n\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer cash system that runs on a decentralized network of (full) nodes that are maintained and operated by volunteers. During the Block Size Wars, there was an ongoing debate to sacrifice decentralization for better scalability. The wars ended with irrelevant forks appearing and disappearing and Bitcoin surviving and thriving ever since. It survived because it chose the path of small blocks to safeguard the peer to peer network.\nSmall blocks represent the trade-off made to preserve the status-quo of the current peer-to-peer network that relies on volunteers around to world to operate and maintain it. If the size of the blocks were to be raised back in 2017, the volunteer based p2p network would have crumbled and killed one of the most important properties of Bitcoin: decentralization.\nWhy? Because running a node in Bitcoin is purely based a voluntary decision. Miners are engaged in the hashing competition, not running decentralized infrastructure. Many blockchains made the fatal mistake to scale too early, putting immense pressure on their underlying, volunteer based peer to peer networks. This totally compromised decentralization in favor of scaling. How many of you can run a Solana or a BNB Chain full node?\n\n“… a novel anti-sybil and anti-spam mechanism called proof of work links that will enhance connectivity within the network and limit certain attacks by sharing their commitment and contributing resources for routing and efficient data delivery.”\n\nLuckily, this mistake was avoided by Zenon by imposing a hard cap for transaction throughput. We still have a chance to get it right. That’s why we need to create strong incentives for a thriving peer-to-peer network layer.\nNow let’s see how and why a hybrid system will prevail, where feeless transactions will coexist with fee based transactions.\n\n“The sentinel nodes will benefit from the fees by consuming them in order to compute the PoW links.”\n\nIn a healthy peer to peer network that aims for decentralization, participants are incentivized to run full nodes. That is exactly the reason why Syrius wallet features an embedded full node. Every one of you running a full node is great for decentralization and self-sovereignty, but without enough public nodes, we saw how the p2p network struggled to serve new users entering into the ecosystem. If there are no incentives to run full nodes, free riding issues will arise and the peer to peer network will eventually collapse. Bitcoin avoided this by hard capping the block size, but NoM is designed to scale Bitcoin, so we can’t afford this cap indefinitely.\nTherefore, fee based incentives are mandatory for the provisioning of the peer to peer layer. Moreover, users should have all the options to transact the way they want to. Even the whitepaper embraces fees in order to deter denial of service attacks and incur a cost for the attacker:\n\n“… adding a transaction fee, which means that the attacker will make the sentinels unavailable at the cost of investing resources in the system, which is a positive aspect for the network and a negative one for the attacker, taking into account that the consensus is unaffected.”\n\nIn my opinion, the following hybrid system will emerge for NoM Phase 1:\n\nFeeless transactions\n\nSupply PoW\nFuse QSR\n\n\nFee based transactions\n\nSupply ZNN\nBurn ZNN\n\n\n\nTo be continued …",

I think ensuring feeless transactions is very important, critical.\nThere are several discussions in the white paper that seem to refer to fees as something other than fused plasma.

Had they increased block size fewer people would be running full nodes.\nNoM hopes to scale BTC.  We will need to uncap our limits.  How do we do that while ensuring decentralization and participation?  We need to incentivize participants to run full nodes (sentinels).  Pillars and Sentinels are the only players that have both chains.\nWe don’t want people querying Pillars and eventually it will be costly and centralized for a few individuals to run public nodes as we scale.\nSolution > Incentive sentinels to run the full node and allow them to be searched.  I don’t know how this “fee” relates to the emissions given to Sentinels for performing their job.\nIs the fee discussed in the white paper a new fee, or does it refer to the emissions paid to Sentinels to do their job?",

It is not mandatory to pay fees.\nBitcoin sacrificed scaling for decentralization such that everyone can run Bitcoin Core on their Raspberry Pi with a modest internet connection.\nIf we want to scale, we need a strong (if you make money you also afford better hardware, etc) p2p layer that doesn’t rely on volunteers.

I don’t think you fully understand the implications for the long term sustainability of the network.\n\n\nI came with argument numerous times, including here, you came with ideology and rephrasing your point over and over.\nMy main point is the following: how abstracting the fee with plasma through QSR and PoW offers less security and scalability / robustness than using native tokens as fee. Both comes with a cost that mitigate spam and attacks, however the later is a bandaid. I’m not the only one saying that.\nBeside and those are your words from another post on this forum: “we don’t have the manpower to implement the feeless route” which means you’re willing to go for a “good enough” idea which poorly mimick others. You never answered this one, and that’s a pretty big one. You might be more technical than anyone of us, but after you wrote that, you can’t keep talking about long term implication. The decision we will take right now will indeed have long term implication, I don’t think you fully understand that. You can’t keep ignoring whatever doesn’t fit your narrative.\nLastly, you talk about incentives for public nodes. Okay good, but do you genuinely think the fee will work here? We have already rewards for Sentinels, Pillars and stakers, a part of that could go to public nodes and that would be much more effective. 0.000003 ZNN per tx will incentive what? Nobody will run public nodes for a fraction of a cent per month. Imagining QSR would apreciate just because of that is a stretch.\nMaybe you just want more funding?\n[image1080×299 40 KB](//hypercore.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/original/1X/29e15ff1fda20bc39000a69fbb626851d336883a.jpeg)",

Bitcoin is amazing because it managed to solve economic and technical problems at the same time.\n\n\n\n 0x3639:\n\nDoes it distinguish between Sentinels and full nodes?\n\n\nYes. Sentinels create PoW links. Full nodes can be Sentinel nodes if they lock collateral. The backbone of the peer-to-peer network are full nodes. Not your node, not your rules.\n\n\n\n 0x3639:\n\nI personally do not think that is sustainable\n\n\nIt’s an amazing first step in the right direction. But not enough.\n\n\n\n 0x3639:\n\nWhy can’t Sentinels act as full nodes open to the public and they receive their incentivization through protocol emissions?\n\n\nSentinels need to lock collateral. You need to be heavily invested into the network to setup a Sentinel node. And Sentinels are fine, they already receive their fair share of rewards from protocol emissions.\nBut not everyone will have that kind of collateral in the future. The peer-to-peer layer is not incentivized and we already saw that no one except a few members will setup public nodes. This is definitely not sustainable in the long run.",

Slow learner.\nPillars > Full Node and Provide consensus and incentivized by the protocol\nSentinel > Full Node, costly to setup, their job is to relay messages and generate PoW links.  They are compensated through protocol emissions.  They are expensive to setup and “hard” to run.  It will be difficult for the general public to run them so we cannot rely on Sentinels as “Public Nodes”.  There won’t be enough of them.\nPublic Nodes > We need as many as possible to improve security and decentralization.  There is no incentive to run them today.  But users need access to them to process TXs and query the chain.  We don’t want “Infura” to run them and we don’t want me to run them.  We want the community to run them, like BTC.  But, our nodes might be more costly to run (for a number of reasons).  So there needs to be an incentive.\nThis is where fees come in.  I don’t think we want to introduce more inflation into the system and emit protocol rewards to Public Nodes.  We don’t need more inflation.  Users can avoid node fees by running their own node.  But if they don’t have the technical skills or desire to do that, they can just add a fee to their TX to pay for someone else’s node.  That way we don’t rely on Infura or me, and we have a public p2p node layer that is paid for by 3rd party fees.\nA user could avoid fees by simply syncing syrius and use the embedded node.  But if they cannot wait, they can use the public node “layer” and pay a fee.\n\nDoes a user select a public node from a “list” and pay a fee to them?\nOr, is there a public node “layer” that shares in all fees received provided they are up and offering access to the network?\n",

They will compete to service users regardless, because they will see only the “plasma” field. Ideally, they won’t know how that Plasma was generated.

Currently there is no user friendly way to trustlessly trade on Network of Momentum.\nP2P Swaps are not a replacement for an AMM or an orderbook based DEX, but the P2P Swap feature will offer a way for all users to conduct feeless OTC swaps with ZTS tokens, allowing for more economic activity to start taking place on Network of Momentum. The need for trustless ways of trading was once again highlighted by the recent unfortunate demise of the only CEX that ZNN and QSR were trading on.\nThe Zenon community has always had an active OTC market and large OTC trades are conducted regularly. A safe and liquid OTC market is especially useful when conducting large trades. Traditionally the downside of OTC trading is that the trading parties have to either trust each other or use a third party escrow that usually requires a fee to conduct the trade.

A straightforward way to find a trading partner is to use OTC chat rooms for example. Automatic matchmaking/an orderbook would have to be considered in a separate proposal.\n[](#what-about-cross-chain-swaps-5)What about cross-chain swaps?\nHTLCs can be used to facilitate cross-chain swaps and initially, when the P2P Swap project was started, the idea was to integrate a user interface for cross-chain swaps into Syrius. After a decent amount of time spent on researching and designing a solution for this, we have decided not to include the cross-chain swap feature into the scope of this proposal.\nReasoning\nWe could provide a relatively user friendly interface for the NoM side of the swap, but since there are basically no wallets on other chains that support HTLC-based cross-chain swaps, it would mean that the swap would have to be done via rudimentary command line tools on the other chains. Based on our testing, doing cross-chain swaps with Bitcoin using a command line tool is hard and error prone. So, even if there was a user friendly interface for the NoM side of the swap, the purpose is defeated when the user has to use rudimentary tooling on other chains.\nAnother option would be to attempt to integrate the full cross-chain swap flow into Syrius for some chains, like Bitcoin, but this will require a significant amount of research and effort to do and will have to be considered in a separate proposal, if there is enough demand for such a feature.\nWe are still actively continuing the testing of cross-chain swaps to see what is technically feasible and what makes sense from a user experience point of view.\n[](#what-has-already-been-delivered-6)What has already been delivered\nThe [first iteration](https://forum.zenon.org/t/p2p-atomic-swaps-in-syrius/1165) of the UI design was presented to the community in November 2022. After feedback from the community and prototyping of the UI, more iterations of the UI design were made until the [final version](https://forum.zenon.org/t/p2p-atomic-swaps-in-syrius/1165/47) of the UI design was presented to the community in March 2023.\nAfter iteration and prototyping, the first version of Syrius with the P2P Swap feature ready for public testing was released a while ago. Instructions on how to try out the P2P Swap feature on the HyperCore One testnet can be found [here](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/syrius-v0-1-0-release-candidate-1-ready-for-community-testing/72).\nPlease note that the P2P Swap feature is only usable on testnet for now.\n[](#what-is-still-to-come-7)What is still to come\nThe P2P Swap feature has not yet been enabled on mainnet. We are close to having a release candidate of Syrius available for public testing that has mainnet support for P2P Swaps.\nA deposit recovery feature is still pending development. This feature will allow a user to recover their deposited swap funds in the unlikely event that they completely lose access to the machine they started the swap on.\nFurther testing and code review is also needed and the tutorial has to be made.\n[](#additional-safety-measures-htlc-watchtower-8)Additional safety measures: HTLC Watchtower\nWork on a watchtower service has been started. In short, the watchtower is a service that anyone can run to improve the safety of P2P swaps. Its purpose is to watch over the swaps that are being conducted on the network to make sure that swap participants receive their funds as expected in situations where Syrius fails to do so for whatever reason. The watchtower utilizes the proxy unlocking feature of the embedded HTLC contract.\nA more detailed write-up of the watchtower can be found [here](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/htlc-watchtower/50).\nHyperCore One is already running an MVP version of the watchtower on both testnet and on mainnet. Hopefully, in the future more watchtowers will be launched by the community to further improve swap safety.\n[](#timeline-9)Timeline\nIf nothing unexpected happens, fully featured releases of Syrius and the HTLC watchtower should be available in Q3.\n[](#funding-request-10)Funding request\nTotal: 13,000 ZNN + 130,000 QSR\nTotal hours put in/allocated: 790h\nIf this proposal is accepted, a payout request will be made for the UI/UX design, research and iteration phase and for 1/4th of the Prototyping, implementation and testing phase.\nThis means a payout request of approximately 35% of the total requested funds, which will be rounded to 4,300 ZNN + 43,000 QSR.\nIf this proposal is accepted, work on the remaining items will be continued. The rest of the funds will be requested in batches, according to the following milestones:\n\n\n1,700 ZNN + 17,000 QSR once a test version of the P2P swap feature that can be used on mainnet is available for public testing.\n\n\n2,000 ZNN + 20,000 QSR once the swap recovery feature has been implemented and is available for public testing, the manual test cases have been written and the tutorial has been made.\n\n\n5,000 ZNN + 50,000 QSR once the fully featured Syrius release and the HTLC watchtower are available and the work items have been completed.\n\n\nWe will wait for a couple of days to respond to feedback and gauge the general sentiment and amount of support for this proposal, until deciding whether to submit it on chain.",

        "text": "A lot of things are possible with the technologies you mentioned, but we have to keep in mind that they are only one piece of the puzzle - even if HTLCs and PTLCs can be used for cross-chain swaps, P2P trading, bridges and more, there are a lot of other components that have to be built to actually deliver an end-to-end service or product that solves an end user problem.\nYou may have already used services that use HTLCs under the hood without even knowing it. Some examples are the [Orion Bridge](https://www.orionprotocol.io/bridge) and the [Magic Protocol Bridge](https://magicstx.gitbook.io/magic-protocol/overview/magic-protocol).\nSince we, HC1, are only one team with limited resources, we need to use our time effectively. This is why we will be actively engaging with Pillars to help define our roadmap for what problems we should be solving to allow for real economic activity to start taking place on NoM.\nUltimately HTLCs and PTLCs are just tools to solve problems. The P2P swaps use HTLCs to facilitate the swaps but nothing is stopping us from using some other technology for them in the future if it makes more sense. The end user doesn’t care about that as long as they achieve their goal.",

The goal is to increase awareness of NoM and onboard new community members and software developers.\nThis project is run by grants from the community.  We plan to run the first phase (test period) for 2 months.  We cannot track conversions or the value of our work.  If we see new community members and/or increased engagement, we will consider this test a “success”.\n[](#explain-the-game-2)Explain the Game\nWe are going to run NoM awareness campaigns on Twitter for the next two months. Each campaign will last seven days.  Users can join the game by making a post with the hashtag #ZenonNetwork. Any post with this hashtag will be entered into the competition.  It’s also possible to change the hashtag in future campaigns.\nEach post will be graded and given an awareness score algorithmically.  The score uses the twitter API and will be updated periodically throughout the day.  The scoring system is closed source to prevent gaming and spamming.  The score takes into account impressions, likes, retweets, and qualities of the poster’s profile.  Post scores are added up for each user during the campaign.  The users with the highest scores will win.\nIf you are not in the top three users during the campaign, you can still win $znn.  All users outside the top three are entered into a raffle.  Each user is given raffle tickets based on the score of their tweets.  The bot will then pick a winning raffle ticket.\n[](#potential-awards-3)Potential Awards\n1st place = 50 ZNN\n2nd place = 35 ZNN\n3rd place = 25 ZNN\nRaffle = 50 ZNN\nIn the event of a tie in score the total reward for the top 3 places (110 $znn) will get prorated across 4 winners\n[](#how-to-play-4)How to Play\nMake a post on twitter with #ZenonNetwork.  That’s it.  [@0x3639](/u/0x3639) on twitter will DM you for a ZTS address to send rewards.\n[](#game-considerations-5)Game Considerations\n\nThe top 21 tweets per user will count during the campaign period.  If you make more than 21 posts, we only count your top 21.\nYour profile score will go up if you have #ZNN, #QSR, $ZNN and/or $QSR in your twitter profile.\nYou may also include [Attribute links](https://attribute.zenon.org/) in your posts and profile to increase your score.\nRetweets, quotes, likes, and impressions improve the original post score.\nYou can quote tweet with the hashtag #ZenonNetwork and that post will count towards the overall score.\nPosts must be 40 characters or longer to be considered.\nAccount age is important to prevent bots and spam.\nA base level of impressions is important to prevent bots and spam.  Posts that are spam with no reach will get a score of zero.\nEach campaign will last 7 days unless otherwise specified.\nAll of the above is subject to change. Check the Telegram bot commands for the most accurate information.\n\n[](#game-tools-6)Game Tools\n\nJoin the Telegram [Twitter Gamez Notices channel](https://t.me/twitter_gamez_notices) to get notified when a campaign stars and ends.

Parachain slots are assigned by an on-chain auction, with auction winners locking up a bond in DOT for the duration of the lease. Auctions and crowdloans raise the bar for blockchain projects, incentivizing them to demonstrate their technology and gain community support prior to launch.\n[](#how-auctions-work-2)How Auctions Work\nBonding\nTo bid in an auction, parachain teams agree to lock up (or bond) a portion of DOT tokens for the duration of the lease. While bonded for a lease, the DOT cannot be used for other activities like staking or transfers.\nAuction Cost\nAfter the lease, the full amount of DOT is unlocked, meaning auctions do not require teams to “spend” DOT. The cost of the lease is best characterized as the opportunity cost of not being able to use the bonded DOT for other activities.\nCrowdloans\nSome parachain teams will fund their auction bid with the help of a crowdloan campaign, which allows them to accept contributions from DOT holders. Crowdloan contributors get their DOT back at the end of the lease, and parachain teams can choose to reward them in various ways, including with a distribution of the parachain’s native token.\nAuction Duration\nAuctions on Polkadot have an open bidding period of approximately 1 week. At the end of the bidding period, the precise moment of the auction’s close is determined retroactively. This prevents last-minute “auction sniping” and promotes more accurate price discovery [(See the case for candle auctions)](https://www.polkadot.network/blog/research-update-the-case-for-candle-auctions/).\nSlot Duration & Lease Periods\nEach slot on the Relay Chain can be leased for a maximum duration of 96 weeks. When bidding on a slot, parachains can choose the length of their desired lease by selecting a contiguous range of 12-week increments known as lease periods. Multiple parachains can win a single auction if they successfully bid on non-overlapping lease periods.\n[](#auctions-timetable-3)Auctions timetable\nEach auction takes place over the course of 1 week and assigns a total slot duration of 96 weeks (divided into 8 12-week lease periods). The schedule is determined via Polkadot’s on-chain governance community.",

        "text": "This thread is meant to combine the research efforts regarding the possibility of using [RandomX](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX) as our Plasma PoW algorithm.\nIn my ongoing research into [Metamask Snaps and wallet provider services](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/metamask-snaps-for-zenon/209/1), I’ve also taken a look at how RandomX PoW would work in that context and I want to share some of the insights I’ve gained.\n[](#background-1)Background\nOur current plasma PoW hashing algorithm is SHA3-256 and this hash algorithm is fine for our current network utilization rate. Since SHA3-256 isn’t an ASIC-resistant algorithm, it would be possible to create an ASIC for it, resulting in PoW generation speeds so high that it would render PoW generation on consumer hardware pointless.\nBuilding such an ASIC isn’t worth it right now, but it can be argued that in a highly utilized, multi-billion dollar network, network throughput would be so valuable that there would be sufficient economic incentive to build such an ASIC.\nRandomX is an (very good) attempt at a maximally ASIC-resistant PoW algorithm. The potential gain in speed from purpose built hardware for RandomX is limited, because of how the algorithm has been [designed](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/blob/master/doc/design.md). Ideally with RandomX, we could be more certain that PoW generation on our network is feasible on hardware that’s readily available to consumers even with high network utilization. This is a significant benefit that RandomX could provide.\nMr. Kaine has also repeatedly advocated using RandomX as the PoW algorithm for plasma generation on our network once we implement dynamic plasma.\n[](#downsides-and-potential-issues-with-randomx-2)Downsides and potential issues with RandomX\nWhile RandomX has many of the qualities we want (primarily the ASIC-resistance), it has some potential problems for us.\nRandomX is a resource intensive algorithm. To run the algorithm in the so called “fast mode”, it requires at least ~2.5 GiB of RAM. During my testing of the RandomX algorithm I noted that initializing the RandomX VM in fast mode took around 30 to 60 seconds and this is with a relatively powerful computer. With lower end hardware this time most likely increases.\nThis means that using the fast mode for PoW generation on clients will increase the waiting time for the user, since whenever PoW needs to be generated, the VM has to be initialized first.\nOne option would be to keep the VM in memory all the time so that it only needs to be initiliazed once at startup, but Syrius is already a memory hog. A total RAM requirement of 5-10 GiB to run Syrius and an embedded node is not ideal if we’re targeting regular consumer computers.\nThis also poses challenges on mobile devices that have limited memory and due to other requirements of the algorithm, it is completely unfeasible to run RandomX in browser environments.\nThe alternative to fast mode is light mode. Light mode runs at a much lower hashrate, but the initialization time is much faster - only around 2 seconds on my computer. Light mode only requires 256 MiB of RAM so it is much more suitable for regular consumer hardware.\nOn my computer the fast mode appears to be around 5x faster than the light mode. So the question is, can clients run in light mode and maintain a fast enough hashrate to generate PoW in a reasonable amount of time?\nFor the sake of comparison, someone using an expensive high end CPU can reach a hashrate that is over 20 times faster than on a low end consumer laptop. If the consumer laptop is running the algorithm in light mode, the difference in speed can be 100x. With ten high end CPUs the difference can be 1000x.\nThese aspects should be taken into account when we consider what the role of PoW is in dynamic plasma.\n[](#randomx-pow-generation-proof-of-concept-3)RandomX PoW generation proof-of-concept\nHere’s a minimal PoC implemenation of our client PoW generation library that has been modified to use RandomX instead of SHA3: [GitHub - hypercore-one/znn-pow-links-cpp at randomx-poc](https://github.com/hypercore-one/znn-pow-links-cpp/tree/randomx-poc)",

Hopefully these long TXs will only happen to fuse QSR or process one off transactions. Personally, I would wait 300 seconds to avoid paying $3-5 like I do today on ETH.\n\n\nThe total waiting time depends completely on what the current difficulty of the network is. If transactions can be sent by just generating PoW and network users start using high-end hardware to send lots of PoW transactions, then the waiting time on regular hardware/mobile phones can become so high that it becomes unfeasible to wait that long.\nLet’s say that it takes around 1 minute to send a normal TX with PoW on a low-end laptop using light mode. At least theoretically someone with a high end CPU farm could send the transaction in 1 min/1000 = 0.06 seconds for example. Now the network’s difficulty would have to adjust to meet the hash power of the CPU farm. So if it takes 1 minute for the CPU farm to send a transaction, the user with the low-end laptop will have to wait for 1min*1000 = 16.6 hours to generate the PoW for a transaction.\nThis is a simplified example but you get the point that balancing the PoW difficulty in such a way that it’s suitable for low-end hardware and not too easy for high-end hardware is a challenge. So like I said we have to consider what role PoW has in dynamic plasma and what our goals are for using PoW as a tx prioritization mechanism.",

Why would other clients provide PoW to Sentinels? Because they can be incentivized to do so by Sentinel operators.\n\n\nMaybe this could be the case but the whitepaper doesn’t seem to suggest this.\nWhat I don’t understand is that Mr K has been clear that the PoW for dynamic plasma should be ASIC-resistant, so if George’s idea of sha256 merge mining is how sentinel PoW is meant to be generated, then why is the founding team using the same terminology for these two supposedly separate PoW systems (e.g. “ZNN PoW Links” lib)?\nThe white paper does talk about pillars doing PoW and utilizing PoW pools (sha256 merge mining?), but that idea hasn’t really been discussed by the community in detail. The whitepaper also only explicitly talks about pillars outsourcing their PoW but doesn’t mention this for sentinels and talks about “small PoW” for sentinels, so it makes me think that sentinel PoW is meant to be light. Does merge mining sha256 fit that goal?\nIf we look at the proposed PoW links algorithm in the whitepaper, the sentinels contribute to the transaction’s overall weight, but it’s not clear whether the sender is allowed to pre-generate weight for the transaction so that min_target_weight is achieved in fewer hops. The min_relay_dimension constant would still set a constraint that even if pre_generated_weight >= min_target_weight the transaction would still need to go through min_relay_dimension hops. If the sender can partake in the PoW link mechanism in this way, the terminology used by the founders makes more sense to me.\n\n\n\n aliencoder:\n\nI’m guessing that MrK wants us to find a way to balance ASIC friendly with CPU friendly PoW.\n\n\nThis is what the WP has to say about PoW balancing. It only refers to it in the context of pillar generated PoW, not sentinel generated PoW:\n\nD. Pillars PoW pools\nIn order for the pillars to be competitive in the process of producing the proof of work, they will have the possibility to outsource it using the mining pool concept. This will create a market efficient ecosystem that will further strengthen the network and clients committing resources for Pillar pools will be rewarded proportionally to their contribution of processing power. We are also investigating the use of a custom difficulty adjustment mechanism that will balance between ASIC-friendly and ASIC-resistant hashing algorithms in order to improve network security and obtain a higher degree of decentralization. We will defer a detailed specification for a later date.\n\nAnd:\n\nE. Adjusting the difficulty of PoW\nAs we have previously stated, the idea behind the proof of work mechanism has multiple advantages – prevents ledger cloning, acts as an additional anti-sybil layer and provides a fair incentivization scheme for the consensus nodes. The PoW will be adjusted in order to keep an epoch at a constant time, for example 1 minute. The algorithm will check at every epoch the time needed for every pillar to solve the proof of work, will remove the outliers and then will compute a median time. We plan to release a self-balancing difficulty algorithm that will use both ASIC-friendly and ASIC-resistant hashing algorithms; if the difficulty is below a threshold an ASIC-friendly hashing algorithm will be activated, and also if the difficulty is above a threshold, an ASIC resistant will come into effect.\n\nSo based on this could it be that plasma & sentinel PoW = randomX and pillar PoW = sha256 & randomX?",

This was an enormous moment for not just WalletConnect but the web3 ecosystem, because WalletConnect v2.0 enables a more reliable and faster end-user experience — and also brought an end to chain switching.\nTo achieve this, WalletConnect v2.0 exposes a developer-friendly abstraction called “[namespaces](https://lqblze.clicks.mlsend.com/te/cl/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjE2NDQ4NyxcImxcIjoxMDEwMzY3ODMxMDMzNzk0MDIsXCJyXCI6MTAxMDM2ODEzNjU5OTMyNDU0fSIsInMiOiI5MTdhODBkYmVjMTc5YTI4In0)”, designed in accordance with [CAIP-25](https://lqblze.clicks.mlsend.com/te/cl/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjE2NDQ4NyxcImxcIjoxMDEwMzY3ODMxMDg2MjIyODMsXCJyXCI6MTAxMDM2ODEzNjU5OTMyNDU0fSIsInMiOiIxYTNhOTNiNDdlMTc3NDc4In0). During the migration, many apps opted to require all of the most critical chains, methods, and events at first connection (i.e. required namespaces), leaving others as optional for end user flexibility (i.e. optional namespaces).\nWhile this implementation works well for many wallets, it creates challenges for others. This includes smart contract wallets like Safe as well as non-smart contract wallets that also run on only one chain at a time as a matter of design.\nTo resolve this issue, we are asking all wallets, both smart contract wallets and others, to test your wallet and upgrade, if need be, so that your wallet can handle all possible namespace scenarios that apps may support.\nGiven the urgency of the matter, we are asking that you test your ability to support namespaces by October 18, 2023 so that we can commence our app outreach and ensure that seamless connection can be enjoyed by all. The test itself takes no longer than a few minutes (if that) and there are details below; if subsequent action is required, you will only need to perform a simple update to your Web3Wallet SDK. Should you have any questions or concerns, reach out to us at [devrel@walletconnect.com](mailto:devrel@walletconnect.com).\nWe recognize the ask involved and take full ownership of the impact caused by the original implementation of namespaces, which overlooked the lift required by certain wallets, in particular smart contract-based ones. We thank WalletConnect users for bringing it to our attention, and we appreciate your patience as we’ve worked to resolve this.\nWhile the above deadline is not a hard deadline, we hope you can complete the steps below as soon as possible. It’s a quick and easy test that goes a long way in ensuring a reliable and first-class connection experience for your wallet’s users.\nHow to ensure your wallet supports namespaces\nTo see if your wallet can connect to apps that have empty or undefined required namespaces, simply connect your wallet to our example app here: [https://se-sdk-dapp.vercel.app/](https://lqblze.clicks.mlsend.com/te/cl/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjE2NDQ4NyxcImxcIjoxMDEwMzY3ODMxMTQ5MTM3NDAsXCJyXCI6MTAxMDM2ODEzNjU5OTMyNDU0fSIsInMiOiI3YWNlMDBjZTdlZTkzY2Q2In0).\nIf you can connect, it is a good indicator that your wallet correctly supports namespaces. Hooray - there’s nothing for you to do!\nIf you can’t connect, we recommend updating your wallet as soon as possible by doing the following.\n\nEnsure you are leveraging our[ namespace builder util tool](https://lqblze.clicks.mlsend.com/te/cl/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjE2NDQ4NyxcImxcIjoxMDEwMzY3ODMxMTgwNTk0NjksXCJyXCI6MTAxMDM2ODEzNjU5OTMyNDU0fSIsInMiOiIwZjhhYTkwZTk2ZDJjNjY4In0) (and the latest Web3Wallet SDK version) which does namespace parsing for you, allowing your wallet to handle all possible namespace scenarios that apps may have as supported by [CAIP-25](https://lqblze.clicks.mlsend.com/te/cl/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjE2NDQ4NyxcImxcIjoxMDEwMzY3ODMxMjMzMDIzNTAsXCJyXCI6MTAxMDM2ODEzNjU5OTMyNDU0fSIsInMiOiJiMDIwNmFjNDhiYTkyNWY2In0).\n\nWeb3Wallet SDK latest versions\nSwift: 1.8.6\nKotlin: BOM-1.17.0\nJavaScript: ^1.9.1\nIf you choose not to leverage our namespace builder (not recommended) or if it is not available on your platform of choice, ensure at a minimum that your wallet can handle the following common usage patterns:\nCase #1 - Recommended default for all apps\n\nrequiredNamespace is empty / undefined\noptionalNamespace is defined\n\nCase #2\n\nrequiredNamespace is defined\noptionalNamespace is defined\n\nCase #3\n\nrequiredNamespace is defined\noptionalNamespace is empty / undefined\n\nCase #4\n\nrequiredNamespace is empty / undefined\noptionalNamespace is empty / undefined\n\nAnd that’s it!\nIf you require technical support along the way, please drop a message on the [WalletConnect GitHub](https://lqblze.clicks.mlsend.com/te/cl/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjE2NDQ4NyxcImxcIjoxMDEwMzY3ODMxMjk1OTM4MDcsXCJyXCI6MTAxMDM2ODEzNjU5OTMyNDU0fSIsInMiOiJlZmY5ZTQzYzBkMzVhYjlhIn0) and our team will get back to you as soon as possible.\nWe want to thank you once again for your patience and support throughout these past few months. Thanks to your cooperation, we can improve web3 experiences for users everywhere.",

        "text": "After a quick dive into these snaps they seem pretty cool.\nThe snaps are completely open and permissionless, meaning that we don’t need to worry about having to publish anything to an “app store”. We just publish an npm package.\nI suspect there will be a ton of development & hype happening around snaps in the near future since the barrier for devs to start building is very low, and you don’t have to worry about lots of the annoying complexities of building a complex extension because MetaMask handles that for you.\nAnd like Aliencoder said, you get access to the MetaMask userbase of millions of people so you don’t need to onboard them into your own extension.\nEVM <> Zenon dapps like the bridge can build a full experience for the user, only requiring MetaMask to be installed. Nothing stopping us from adding Bitcoin functionality into the snap as well.\nFor the purpose of allowing low effort, maximally easy onboarding into our network, I think this is a good option for that.\nSome technical aspects and ideas to consider:\n\n\nI think being able to send PoW transactions with the snap is crucial for an easy onboarding experience. The need for gas in EVM networks is such a UX painpoint.\nApparently WASM can be used with snaps, but there seem to be limitations to how long a background process can be executed for on the snap: [https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/lifecycle/](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/lifecycle/)\n60 seconds may not be enough to send a PoW TX but we’ll need to investigate this some more.\n\n\nIt would be nice to allow the user to use a local node with the snap. The snap could work as a proxy between a webapp and a local node. We would have to define an RPC interface that webapps could use to make RPC calls to the node through the snap.\n\n\nCron jobs could possibly be used to automate the receiving of TXs in the background (among other stuff): [https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/exports/#oncronjob](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/exports/#oncronjob)\n\n\nThe snap could be used as just a simple keystore & node provider for dapps. UIs for basic NoM functionality (like staking, delegating, etc.) and the EVM bridge could be provided by webapps (that anyone can build) and the snap would just be used to sign & send transactions and provide a node connection. Of course all this functionality could be built directly into the snap as well.\n\n\nI’m impressed at what MetaMask is doing here.\n\n\n\n aliencoder:\n\nUsers will be able to easily swap ZNN to XZNN directly inside Metamask.\n\n\nYes exactly. Could probably make a smooth experience between ETH <> ZNN <> XZNN.",

        "text": "I spent some more time testing and researching the snaps platform and made the following findings:\n\n\nKeystore generation works - a zenon keystore can be derived from the metamask account. This means that the zenon keystore is tied to your metamask account. It should not be possible for anyone to link your EVM accounts to the zenon account.\n\n\nThe snap can indeed be used as a relay between a webapp and a local node, meaning that dapps can be used with a local node.\n\n\nPoW generation:\n\n\nThe 60 second timeout is still a problem. There is currently a feature in the snap environment that allows for long running processes to be executed, but unfortunately this feature is deprecated and will be removed soon. On the bright side the snaps team is actively working on providing a new solution for long running tasks: [Long running Snaps for synchronous work · Issue #1604 · MetaMask/snaps · GitHub](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/issues/1604)\n\n\nUsing the current C++ implementation for PoW generation via WASM isn’t really feasible in a snap. The snap runs in a [secure execution environment](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/execution-environment/) that has limitations that complicate the usage of WASM in a snap. There have also been reports of issues with WASM performance: [Investigate wasm performance · Issue #1422 · MetaMask/snaps · GitHub](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/issues/1422)\n\n\nI overcame the WASM issues by rewriting the PoW algorithm to work with Typescript directly which allows it to be run inside the snap.\n\n\n[](#pow-generation-feasibility-with-dynamic-plasma-and-randomx-1)PoW generation feasibility with dynamic plasma and RandomX\nA new problem that came up in regards to PoW generation within browser environments is that if we change the PoW algorithm to RandomX, like has been suggested, then browser-only onboarding into our network will not be possible. It is not viable to compute RandomX in browser environments: [RandomX/README.md at master · tevador/RandomX · GitHub](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/blob/master/README.md#does-randomx-facilitate-botnetsmalware-mining-or-web-mining)\nThis means that browser based wallets, like the snap wallet, will have to rely on either a separate locally run program that can do the PoW generation, or on external services that provide PoW or Plasma as a service. Currently the only way to onboard onto our network without external services is by doing PoW transactions.\nIf the snap wallet requires the user to install a separate program on their computer to be able to use the wallet, it interferes with the idea of using browser wallets to allow for a very low effort onboarding experience. Getting the user to install and trust the program is a UX challenge.\nAnother option is to build external PoW and Plasma services that can be used by wallets, but how are such services incentivized?\n[](#high-level-view-of-a-snap-wallet-and-the-related-components-2)High level view of a snap wallet and the related components\n[snap1469×711 23.8 KB](//hypercore.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/original/1X/e378cdb9291831ca71e6c738f1cc6a4984ac75c0.png)",

Here’s a detailed summary based on the extracted content:\n[](#abstract-2)Abstract\n\nBitVM is a computing paradigm designed to express Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts without altering the network’s consensus rules.\nComputations are not executed on Bitcoin but are verified, akin to optimistic rollups.\nA prover claims that a given function evaluates for specific inputs to a particular output. If the claim is false, a verifier can perform a succinct fraud proof and punish the prover.\nThis mechanism allows any computable function to be verified on Bitcoin.\nCommitting to a large program in a Taproot address requires significant off-chain computation and communication, but the resulting on-chain footprint is minimal.\nComplex, stateful off-chain computation can be performed without leaving any trace in the chain, as long as both parties collaborate.\nOn-chain execution is only required in case of a dispute.\n\n[](#introduction-3)Introduction\n\nBitVM creates a novel design space for more expressive Bitcoin contracts and off-chain computation.\nPotential applications include games (Chess, Go, Poker), verification of validity proofs in Bitcoin contracts, bridging BTC to foreign chains, building a prediction market, and emulating novel opcodes.\nThe model is limited to a two-party setting with a prover and a verifier and requires significant off-chain computation and communication for both parties.\n\n[](#architecture-4)Architecture\n\nBitVM is based on fraud proofs and a challenge-response protocol, similar to Optimistic Rollups and the MATT proposal.\nIt doesn’t require changes to Bitcoin’s consensus rules and is primarily based on hashlocks, timelocks, and large Taproot trees.\nThe prover commits to the program bit-by-bit, and the verifier performs a sequence of challenges to succinctly disprove a false claim of the prover.\nA sequence of challenge-and-response transactions is pre-signed by the prover and verifier, which they can later use to resolve any dispute.\nThe model illustrates that this approach allows for universal computations on Bitcoin.\n\n[](#bit-value-commitment-5)Bit Value Commitment\n\nThe bit value commitment allows the prover to set the value of a particular bit to either “0” or “1”.\nIt contains two hashes, hash0 and hash1, and the prover sets the bit’s value by revealing the preimage of one of the hashes.\nRevealing both preimages allows the verifier to use them as a fraud proof and take the prover’s deposit, which is termed equivocation.\nThis commitment is binding due to the ability to punish equivocation, making it an “incentive-based commitment”.\n\n[](#logic-gate-commitment-6)Logic Gate Commitment\n\nAny computable function can be represented as a Boolean circuit, with the NAND gate being a universal logic gate.\nThe implementation of a NAND gate commitment contains two bit commitments representing the two inputs and a third bit commitment representing the output.\nThe Script computes the NAND value of the two inputs to ensure that it matches the committed output bit.\n\n[](#binary-circuit-commitment-7)Binary Circuit Commitment\n\nNAND gate commitments can express any circuit by composing gate commitments.\nEvery step of the execution is committed to in a Tapleaf, all combined into the same Taproot address, enabling the prover to execute any gate in the circuit.\n\n[](#challenges-and-responses-8)Challenges and Responses\n\nCommitting to a circuit is not enough to disprove an incorrect claim, so the verifier must be able to challenge the prover’s statement.\nThis is facilitated by pre-signing a sequence of transactions during setup, linked like challenge → response → challenge → response, etc.\n",

To allow inbound and outbound traffic on this port, run:\n\nsudo ufw allow 22/tcp\n\n\nAllow Traffic on Port 35995 (TCP and UDP):\nTo allow both inbound and outbound traffic on port 35995 for both TCP and UDP, execute the following commands:\n\nsudo ufw allow 35995/tcp\nsudo ufw allow 35995/udp\n\n\nVerify the Rules:\nTo ensure that the rules have been added correctly, you can list all the active rules with:\n\nsudo ufw status\n\n\nOptional - Deny All Incoming Traffic:\nIf you want to deny all other incoming traffic (recommended for security reasons) but allow outgoing traffic, you can set the default policies as follows:\n\nsudo ufw default deny incoming\nsudo ufw default allow outgoing\n\nNote: This step is optional and is recommended for security. If you perform this step, only the ports you’ve explicitly allowed (like 22 and 35995) will accept incoming traffic.\n\nReload UFW:\nAfter making all the changes, reload UFW to apply the new rules:\n\nsudo ufw reload\n\nThat’s it! The node should be running and it’s being protected by UFW and configured to allow traffic on ports 22 and 35995 for both TCP and UDP. Remember to periodically check and update your firewall rules to ensure the security of your system.\n[](#build-the-modified-dart-cli-on-the-computer-with-syrius-3)Build the Modified Dart CLI on the Computer with Syrius\nNext we are going to build the ZNN Dart CLI with the pillar.registerLegacy command.  Open the computer where syrius is installed.  These instructions assume you are using a mac.\n[](#install-dart-sdk-2140-300-4)Install Dart SDK (>2.14.0 < 3.0.0)\nThe cli tool does not support the latest Dart SDK. It is constrained to >2.14.0 < 3.0.0.\nAlso the znn_sdk_dart (to Sentrify nodes) requires >=2.19.0 <3.0.0.

Every command should be accompanied by the -u ws://127.0.0.1:35998 flag to connect to a local node.  You cannot use a node with big int support.  These instructions assume you are using the public node provided by hypercore.one.  The instructions were recreated from these [Reference Instructions](https://github.com/vilkris4/znn_cli_dart/blob/register_legacy_pillar/docs/tutorials/legacy_pillar_registration.md).  Please reference them if you are using Windows to run the CLI.\n[](#step-1-7)Step 1\nFuse 150 QSR as Plasma to the address (NOT the producer address) you will be using for the Pillar.\n[](#step-2-8)Step 2\nVerify that the address you will be using for the Pillar has the required ZNN (15,000) and QSR (150,000). Add the -i flag to the end of the command and specify the index of the address you will be using for the Pillar. If you are using Syrius, you can view the address list to get the index of the address. The index of the first address is 0, the second one is 1, the third one is 2, etc.\n./znn-cli balance -i 0 -u wss://legacy.hc1node.com:35998\n\nor\n./znn-cli balance -i 0 -k [KeystoreName] -u wss://legacy.hc1node.com:35998\n\n[](#step-3-9)Step 3\nDeposit the 150,000 QSR needed to register the Pillar. The QSR will be burned when the Pillar is registered. Again, add the -i flag to the end of the command to specify the index of the address.\n./znn-cli pillar.depositQsr 150000 -i 0 -u wss://legacy.hc1node.com:35998\n\n[](#step-4-10)Step 4\nWait a short while and verify the QSR was deposited successfully.\n./znn-cli pillar.getDepositedQsr -i 0 -u wss://legacy.hc1node.com:35998\n\n[](#step-5-11)Step 5\nEverything is now set up and the pillar can be registered. You should have obtained the legacyPillarPubKey and legacyPillarSignature from the seller of the legacy Pillar slot.\nRegister the pillar with the following command. Replace the arguments with your own values and remember to add the -i flag to the end of the command to specify the index of the address you are using.\nDouble check that there are no typos in the name, since it cannot be changed once the Pillar has been registered.\n./znn-cli pillar.registerLegacy name producerAddress rewardAddress giveBlockRewardPercentage giveDelegateRewardPercentage legacyPillarPubKey legacyPillarSignature -i 0 -u wss://legacy.hc1node.com:35998\n\nExample command with real arguments:\n./znn-cli pillar.registerLegacy Anvil z1qzkd8urw7c4wg6x0cvd2nrzr4ke9d4zh0tvd8s z1qptjd99906x57ej6n55zvmsdm234lngrsreyc2 0 0 BGAjJAT6H2LkTDe3I1Iwoh2XGr+17u8gXI6k1bESJALhW/pInYwN8FEi8zCVUqQc55Tb+GpyP6MpiwCglm2M/Po= H0+k3lo/QvW+myeQ2GzKKjUWyJh96xERkiuyXStNNTocL+5NaCiTjC/b+E2NEHcT1jt/B3gf5L5T1rbXlCfA7VA= -i 0 -u wss://legacy.hc1node.com:35998\n\n[](#step-6-12)Step 6\nWait a short while and verify the Pillar was registered successfully by checking the Pillar list.\n./znn-cli pillar.list -u wss://legacy.hc1node.com:35998\n",

These instructions got a little expanded based on feedback from multiple participants.  Initially they were generic but we have expanded them with each not launch.\nBut I agree, the 24 seed wallet should NOT be imported into the pillar.  I’m going to adjust these instructions.  I think the issue is many users probably don’t have multiple linux machines to do this from.    So doing it from the Pillar is “EZ” but not safe.",

Of course, these goals are subjective. As the subject matter expert in your own domain, I know you’ll do your best to ensure the codebase is maintained well.\nI think there should be an expressed desire for a particular change before it’s implemented.\nThis can come from a community member, any developer, anyone; as long as there seems to be a need, we can probably justify the change.\nThis expression can be made on any social media, though I would prefer if it’s captured in a Github issue to simplify the tracking of progress.\nWe can also use Github Project boards.\nSome updates will take hours to validate and test. We should try to respect each others’ time; be sure that your code is complete and in working condition before asking others to review it.\nWe may want to adopt a rule that the person who submits a PR cannot also approve it.\nWhen reviewing a PR, try to submit feedback that is more verbose than ‘lgtm’, though it’s probably acceptable in some circumstances, like one-line PRs or text changes.\nUse your best judgment and express yourself if you think something should be different.\nI’m of the opinion that PRs should be small in size, easy to digest and test, simple to roll back.\nThere will still be exceptionally large PRs for more complex initiatives, but I ask that we strive to reduce the burden of validation by making incremental code changes.\nIt’s much easier to verify ten lines of code than 500 or 5000.\nI would like us to disclose test plans with our PRs.\nThis is to keep ourselves accountable for quality assurance, and to inform others that a certain test scope has been covered. We may need multiple participants to validate a PR before it’s accepted into production.\n\nThese are all suggestions for how we should proceed.\nTry to see this from the perspective of a developer that just discovered Zenon.\n\nWho is able to answer their questions?\nWhat can they work on?\nWhere can they find more information?\nHow do they contribute?\n\nSome of these questions are out of scope for this topic but we still need to answer them.",

This document explains the practical process and guidelines for\ncontributing.\n\nFirst, in terms of structure, there is no particular concept of \"Bitcoin Core\ndevelopers\" in the sense of privileged people. Open source often naturally\nrevolves around a meritocracy where contributors earn trust from the developer\ncommunity over time. Nevertheless, some hierarchy is necessary for practical\npurposes. As such, there are repository maintainers who are responsible for\nmerging pull requests, the [release cycle](/doc/release-process.md), and\nmoderation.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nNew contributors are very welcome and needed.\n\n\n\n\n  This file has been truncated.

        "text": "I’m also interested in doing the Bitcoin integration into Syrius if we want to focus on that next. I would first create and design a UX for it and present and discuss it with the community before starting the implementation. Similarly to how the P2P swaps UX was done.\nThe design would consider the full experience from using the BTC wallet to conducting cross-chain P2P swaps with Bitcoin.\nWith that said, I want to note that in terms of ZTS <> BTC P2P swaps, I don’t think we necessarily need to integrate a BTC wallet into Syrius where the user stores/sends/receives funds. If you’re coming from Bitcoin into the Zenon ecosystem, it’s an extra step for you to have to first send your BTC into Syrius to swap it. Syrius would use one-time BTC keypairs on a per-swap basis to manage the swap, so from the user’s perspective they don’t need to send BTC in and out of Syrius to swap.\nSo is a full BTC wallet integration needed right now considering most bitcoiners will probably want to store and manage their BTC in their wallet of choice?\nAnother option for ZTS <> BTC swaps would be to create a webapp mimicing a “Uniswap experience”. This would require the automated market making clients that George mentioned. Since we now have WalletConnect in Syrius the full UX of the swap could be done in the webapp.\nIf done correctly this could result in a simple Uniswap-like interface where the user is directly swapping with the automated market making clients without knowing it. From their perspective they’re just magically swapping ZTS and BTC. The same idea could be used for ZTS <> ZTS swaps.\nSuch a system would of course be much trickier to create since the market making clients and the matchmaking system would have to be developed, and without a doubt there are many pitfalls there.",

Syrius still needs the capability to create BTC keypairs and needs a connection to a BTC node, but the HTLC contract’s P2SH address can be funded from the user’s BTC wallet of choice instead of a BTC wallet inside Syrius.\nIf the swap is unsuccessful, the user can recover their deposit with Syrius with the swap’s one-time keypair. The user inputs the address they want to receive the recovered funds on. This should work unless I’m missing something.\n\n\n\n georgezgeorgez:\n\nfrom a systematic standpoint, building the base layer capability would make sense, but from an adoption/trend standpoint, integrating with lightning first may be better\n\n\nBase layer vs lightning I’m not sure. That’s up for debate which makes more sense for us. Would base layer have more volume/liquidity?\n\n\n\n sol:\n\nbitcoin_base seems viable, though it was only published a month ago. We should perform a security evaluation for any such dependencies, as well as rigorous testing to confirm compatibility.\n\n\nWhen I tried out bitcoin_base it had some obvious issues, so it doesn’t seem production ready yet at least.",

        "text": "Hmm… We need to dive into what the actual utxo scripts and unlocking process would be. I’m not 100% sure.\nWhen I say “btc fees are real” I mean that we should not rely on making actual txs to organize utxos into the right wallets. Importing keys is also a pain for the average user.\n\nLet’s say Alice starts with a single utxo “A” that is managed by an existing BTC wallet. She is swapping for Bob’s ZNN.\nCase 1: Alice locks first.\n\n\nBob must provide Alice a BTC address/keypair to send to. Alice provides Bob a ZNN address. They agree to swap timing parameters.\n\n\nAlice generates a preimage secret.\n\n\nAlice broadcasts a BTC tx that looks roughly like:\nInputs\nA - must be signed by the existing wallet\nOutputs\nB - htlc script: within a certain number of blocks, only Bob’s provided key can unlock if he provides preimage to specified hashlock. After that number of blocks, can be can unlocked by Alice’s existing wallet. (I think this script should be possible right?)\nA’ - Change that can be unlocked by the existing wallet\n\n\nNote: Unlike in NoM, Alice does not need to explicitly reclaim her funds if the timelock expires. In fact she shouldn’t as that would require an unnecessary on-chain tx.\nAlice’s BTC wallet must be able create such a TX, and recognize utxo B as under its ownership if the timelock should expire. Ideally it should be able to generate/manage preimages as well, or it must be able to easily accept a preimage as a param when creating the htlc. Not sure if we can assume that most wallets have these capabilities.\n\n\nAlice must inform Bob of the tx she just created or Bob must be scanning the BTC chain. In any case, Bob must be able to interpret the script of B and verify that it is what he and Alice agreed to.\n\n\nBob creates an HTLC on NoM using the same hashlock and an expiration time (NOT BLOCK HEIGHT) that is expected to expire before the BTC \"time\"lock (blockheight lock) expires. This should be the subject of a whole other discussion.\n\n\nBob must either inform Alice of the nom htlc or Alice must scan. This is the same as the ZTS-ZTS and the htlc lookup by id can be used. Alice must verify the parameters.\n\n\nAlice can then unlock Bob’s htlc on NoM. She will need to use the preimage she used for the BTC htlc. How smooth this is would depend on her wallet(s) support for preimage management.\n\n\nBob needs to scan NoM for preimages. And then once it finds it, he needs to get it over to his bitcoin wallet, so that it can sweep output B. Again how smooth this is depends on his wallet(s) support for preimage management.\n\n\n\nI will do the same analysis in a bit for Case 2: Bob locks first\nI think it will be similar but need to be thorough.\n\n\n\n vilkris:\n\nThe complexity would be managed in a single spot, in Syrius. Syrius still needs the capability to create BTC keypairs and needs a connection to a BTC node, but the HTLC contract’s P2SH address can be funded from the user’s BTC wallet of choice instead of a BTC wallet inside Syrius.\nIf the swap is unsuccessful, the user can recover their deposit with Syrius with the swap’s one-time keypair. The user inputs the address they want to receive the recovered funds on. This should work unless I’m missing something.\n\n\nCan you explain your understanding of the funding step a little more?\nAre you saying that first we will do a simple BTC send to an address managed by Syrius which will then create the BTC HTLC?\nIt’s an extra transaction which has tx fees ($$)\nIf we don’t want the extra tx, we either need outside wallets to have direct support for HTLCs.\nEven if those wallets can broadcast a raw tx templated by Syrius (not a great ux), I’m not sure they will recognize htlc utxos.\nFor reclaim/recover, it seems like you are broadcasting an extra tx on chain ($$) which you don’t need to simply for the sake of wallet organization, instead of managing keys.",

The expired HTLC can only be spent with the refund script, for which you need the HTLC’s details if the script has to be reconstructed. You also need the funding tx’s data. How do we back up that information? If they import their keys to any other wallet they will not have access to the funds.\nIn the case of an automated market making client this could make sense to manage and backup the expired HTLCs so they could be used as inputs directly, since that BTC wallet and client would be used for one purpose only and managing the refund details could be feasible.\n\n\n\n georgezgeorgez:\n\nCan you explain your understanding of the funding step a little more?\nAre you saying that first we will do a simple BTC send to an address managed by Syrius which will then create the BTC HTLC?\nIt’s an extra transaction which has tx fees ($$)\nIf we don’t want the extra tx, we either need outside wallets to have direct support for HTLCs.\nEven if those wallets can broadcast a raw tx templated by Syrius (not a great ux), I’m not sure they will recognize htlc utxos.\n\n\nSyrius creates the HTLC script which is converted to a P2SH address that can be funded from any wallet.

There are very few examples utilizing P2TR, so it would require a deep understanding of taproot and BTC transactions in general to get it right.\n\n\n\n georgezgeorgez:\n\nBut is backing up that data in Syirus much complex than backing up preimages in Syrius which we probably have to do in some way already?\n\n\nFor ZTS swaps we store preimages in a local database, but that db is just available for that instance of Syrius. This doesn’t really matter on NoM because you can always recover your funds from the smart contract with your address and the HTLC’s ID.\nWith BTC you need the refund script in order to recover. In case the client’s data storage is wiped out, I’ve seen two ways of managing this in existing HTLC swap clients:\n\nGive the user the option to export the refund script + the swap’s private key into a text file for later use.\nStore the refund script encrypted in some external storage that can be accessed and decrypted by a keypair held by the user.\n\n\n\n\n georgezgeorgez:\n\nIf you’re doing anything more complex than a p2pkh, won’t there usually be additional data that has to be backed up by the wallet?

But yeah I see your point.\n\n\nYes it’s a downside but if the swap is funded from an internal BTC wallet inside Syrius, then the user will have to make an extra transaction to first fund the Syrius BTC wallet. If the swap is funded from an external wallet then at least in the happy case scenario it will only require both parties to pay for one BTC tx.\nIf the user imports their BTC keys into Syrius, then we couldn’t use the NoM keypair’s entropy to deterministically create the BTC wallet.",

I think I would just use the library directly and not copy it over as such.\nThe critical files to update are in the “protocol” folder.\nSpecifically the implementation for the “Broadcaster” interface; (i[nterfaces.go](https://github.com/zenon-network/go-zenon/blob/v0.0.7-alphanet/protocol/interfaces.go))\ntype Broadcaster interface {\n\tSyncInfo() *SyncInfo\n\tCreateMomentum(*nom.MomentumTransaction)\n\tCreateAccountBlock(*nom.AccountBlockTransaction)\n}\n\nThe current implementation ([broadcaster.go](https://github.com/zenon-network/go-zenon/blob/v0.0.7-alphanet/protocol/broadcaster.go))\ntype broadcaster struct {\n\tlog      common.Logger\n\tchain    chain.Chain\n\tprotocol *ProtocolManager\n}\n\nfunc NewBroadcaster(chain chain.Chain, protocol *ProtocolManager) Broadcaster {\n\treturn &broadcaster{\n\t\tlog:      common.ProtocolLogger.New(\"submodule\", \"broadcaster\"),\n\t\tchain:    chain,\n\t\tprotocol: protocol,\n\t}\n}\n\nProtocolManager is from [handler.go,](https://github.com/zenon-network/go-zenon/blob/master/protocol/handler.go)\nAnd this is what actually calls interfaces with the underlying p2p networking stack\nSo basically we implement a Broadcaster with a ProtocolManager that interfaces with an underlying libp2p stack instead.",

I hope to timebox this for 2 weeks ending July 4th.\nI welcome all to participate: developers and non-developers. I have created an AZ proposal to ask the pillars to set aside 5k ZNN, 50k QSR for this planning and design phase. I need to work out the specifics, but at the end of the timebox, I will ask the pillars to assign votes to contributors so that we can fairly distribute those funds.\nI don’t want to dominate the discussion and want to allow others to make a contribution first, so I will wait until tomorrow before I start posting my thoughts.\nPlease refrain from adding comments of support or disagreement that do not further the conversation. I will likely moderate these out. For example, “Great idea!”. If there is an approach you like, the best way to show support is to further develop the conversation in that direction.",

        "text": "Thanks for kicking off this topic, George. Here are some of my thoughts.\n\nWhat is the governance model trying to achieve?\n\nThe ability to manage runtime variables and call embedded functions as the administrator\nThis includes creating and activating sporks, and executing functions related to the bridge and liquidity contracts\n\nScope of change\n\ngo-zenon – write/test the governance embedded contract\ngo-zenon\n– update all variables that we wish to define dynamically\n– consider variables that are defined by a combination of other variables → may need to simplify\nSDKs – update all the same variables to dynamically source values from contract’s db\nclients – update any remaining variable references the same way as the SDKs\nclients – ability to interact with the governance contract\n– Syrius implementation will be different from znn-cli\n\nGovernance contract interface\n\n\nFunctions\ncreatePoll()\nendPoll()\ngetPolls()\ngetVariable()\nupdateVariable() – includes creating/deleting variables\nexecuteFunction(function, params, execution height)\n\n\nVariables\nvariableDb\npollDb\npollFee\npollOptions\npollDuration\npollQuorum\n\n\nIncentives\nSince we’re discussing the implementation for a new voting system, I propose that we consider updating participant incentives.\nI’ve written a [post about this](https://forum.zenon.org/t/proposal-apply-decay-multiplier-for-pillars-who-do-not-vote/504/14), but it didn’t garner much attention.\nI’ll summarize the arguments here:\n\nPoll spammers should be penalized\nPillars should be rewarded for casting votes\nValid poll submissions should not incur penalties\n\nWe can achieve these objectives with the following policy adjustments:\n\nPoll initiators must lock pollFee ZNN in the contract\nSpam polls meet the following criteria:\n\nif spamVotes > sum(yes, no, abstain) after pollDuration or if spamVotes == pollQuorum\n\ndonate locked ZNN to AZ\ndelete the poll from pollDb\n\n\n\n\nAll other poll outcomes are valid —> refund the initiator when the poll completes\n\nPillar yields or some other reward can be subject to a voting participation multiplier, but I think this point should be reserved for a separate discussion.\nPillars will already be incentivized to vote if they want changes applied to mainnet.\nExecution Flow\nA user will submit a poll to the governance contract\n\nThey will enter a json payload that the contract executes if the poll is accepted\nThe poll costs pollFee to submit, locking the funds for pollDuration\nThe poll ends after pollDuration\n\nPillars will submit their votes.\n\nOptions for the poll will include: Yes, No, Abstain, Spam\nThey may re-cast their votes while the poll is still active.\n\nAfter pollDuration, the poll will finish.\n\nIf pollQuorum is met and yesVotes > sum(no, abstain, spam) → execute the json payload\n\n\n\nExample of a json payload for a poll\n{\n  \"<poll-id>\": {\n    \"variables\": [\n      {\n        \"pollDuration\": \"604800\",\n        \"activationHeight\": \"4321000\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"pollFee\": \"30000000\",\n        \"activationHeight\": \"4321000\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"bridgeAdministrator\": \"z1qxemdeddedxg0vernancexxxxxxxxxxxklyh23\",\n        \"activationHeight\": \"4321000\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"liquidityAdministrator\": false,\n        \"activationHeight\": \"4321000\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"functions\": [\n      {\n        \"function\": \"embedded.spork.CreateSpork\",\n        \"parameters\": [\n          \"<spork name>\",\n          \"<spork description>\"\n        ],\n        \"executionHeight\": \"4200040\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"function\": \"embedded.spork.ActivateSpork\",\n        \"parameters\": [\n          \"<spork id>\"\n        ],\n        \"executionHeight\": \"4321000\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nIn this example, we would be:\n\nupdating four runtime variables – three value changes and one deletion\ncreating a spork and activating it two weeks later\nNote: realistically, we may want two separate votes for spork creation and activation.\n\nLimitations\n\nOnly predefined functions in the governance contract can be executed.\nA spork would be required to change these.\nThis is because I don’t see a way to define a variable with another variable.\n\nThe challenge I faced here:\ninstead of passing abstracted function names and params, can we pass the parameters to build AccountBlocks directly in the poll?\nSeems like we also need to pass the ABI for the specific method we’re calling.\nPerhaps we can rely on clients to pre-format these data values?\nI can’t dynamically define these function -> ABI method associations so they will need to be manually configured in the contract.\n\n\n\nOther considerations\n\nWe’ll need to sanitize the json payload input to ensure [only valid characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack) are passed to the rest of the system.\n\n\nPS: I think 5k/50k is expensive for any discussion/planning phase.",

Of course, it should be variable based on how important the work is. Since these funds are not earmarked for me, but will be subject to pillar vote, even if we are possibly overpaying for this trial, I don’t think it will be towards anyone in particular. I’m optimistic about participation.\nNext, I will directly challenge the idea that it won’t ever be worth that amount. A thorough design phase goes a long way in ensuring that we get the best price for implementation, and in better timeframes.\nAt least from personal experience, a lot of my hesitation when it comes to development, comes from a fear that I’ll have to scrap it later on. Removing this hesitation gets us faster deliveries.\nAnd without a open process, there is incentive/pressure to “claim” work by producing some semblance of code for it. In that situation, I highly doubt that the design will be what is best for the community. In some cases, the cost of correcting or improving the design in the future, will far outweigh any investment into upfront open and collaborative design.\nThere are likely also many contributors, especially newer or potential community members, who can’t do the end-to-end delivery, but who can deliver a well defined piece of work. A good planning/design phase opens up the door to much greater competition.\nI can envision scenarios where work that a single team would ask for 2 or more AZ proposals to cover could instead first undergo a proposal for open design and then end up with a competitive set of implementation proposals that overall saves us money.\nOn a longer horizon, as code generation/AI assisted development becomes more mature, the line between design and implementation will blur. In the future, design will be the brunt of the work.\nAfter this first trial run, I think it will be a good idea to open up a discussion on how to determine the right amount to set aside for planning/design.",

        "text": "I am grateful for the thoughtful and insightful discussions taking place and the services provided by the hc1 crew. I would like to contribute some of my thoughts, which, while not groundbreaking and probably already accounted for, have not been mentioned yet:\n\nTransparency and Accountability: It’s crucial that our governance model is both transparent and accountable. To ensure this, I am sure to be just echoing our intent to:\n\n\nMaintain a comprehensive log of all changes enacted through the governance contract.\nMake these logs easily accessible to all members of our community, enabling any member to review past decisions and understand the rationale behind them.\n\n\nDelay Period: We should consider implementing a delay period between when a proposal is accepted and when the changes are implemented. I think this should be different than the time until the activation height. The benefits of this delay would include:\n\n\nAllowing community members time to digest and respond to approved proposals.\nEnsuring that decisions are made collectively and aren’t rushed.\nAct as a time-constraint security measure, similar to what sumamu implemented in the bridge.\n\nIn regards to Sol’s points, here are some more thoughts:\n\n\nVariable Management: Sol proposed the updateVariable() function, which implies creating and deleting variables. My understanding is that we are planning to replace hardcoded values with variables that we can later adjust through on-chain voting, not introduce new variables. This approach keeps our system flexible while mitigating the risks associated with adding new variables and/or logic.\n\n\nNaming Conventions: Sol’s proposed names are concise, but I suggest we prioritize clarity, even if it means slightly longer names. For instance:\n\n\n\npollDb could be renamed to pollDatabase.\npollFee could be renamed to pollSubmissionFee.\n\nI’ll let the on-chain experts decide if this is worth it in terms of chain/binary bloat. Makes me wonder, is there even a thing as minifying the go contract like what they do with js for websites?\n\nDefining Governance Framework: While Sol clearly addressed the module interface and what it’s trying to achieve i.e creating sporks, altering runtime variables, changing the bridge admin key. I think that rather than focusing on the specific actions or functions, it might be beneficial to take a step back and define the theoretical objectives of our governance module. To this end, it could be worthwhile to work on outlining a clear governance framework that describes the principles, goals, and limitations of what the module should and should not be able to achieve. This framework would serve as a guiding document for the design and implementation of our governance module and could be adjusted over time as the needs of the community evolve. I believe this is what George is kinda trying to achieve with the discussions, and not just the technical implementation details.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts on these suggestions and continuing the productive dialogue.",

        "text": "I think we’ll have to iterate on the governance embedded.\nBut I want us to be conscious and transparent about what we are putting off until later.\nMy personal goal is to have the first iteration ready to ship by end of July.\nScopes\nSo I want to first delineate 3 different scopes:\n\n\nWe currently have existing centralized admin functions. We need to quickly mitigate the possible harm without getting rid of any possible benefits.\n\n\nIt is likely that future embedded contracts will adopt an admin pattern as well so that it doesn’t have to duplicate governance logic. We should think about what a scalable solution looks like and consider different options in terms of sophistication vs delivery time.\n\n\nA good on-chain governance system could be extended to many areas and applications. For example, as reflected in Sol’s post, we have had discussions before about how we can turn what are currently hard-coded constants into dynamic on-chain values which can be subject to governance. I’m also thinking with extension chains and chain relay that higher layers can utilize governance from the root chain.\n\n\nGovernance Framework: Theory\nIn terms of theory and a governance framework, we can look at real world governance systems and the balance of power. We have the legislative branch which writes the law, the executive branch which applies the law, and the judicial branch which interprets the law.\nI think it’s useful to think about how these concepts and concerns translate to decentralized networks overall and in particular to NoM. Maybe later, we can talk about pillar burn vs delegation in terms of governance.\nBut in terms of actionable discussion, I want to point out that legislatures are often slow to act, if they can come to agreement to at all. However in many situations, e.g. war, quick and decisive action is needed. So legislatures often have means to grant additional temporary executive power.\nAnd I think we will have to design with this as a consideration, especially given the maturity of our current pillar set.\nPossible Implementations\nz1qxemdeddedxg0vernancexxxxxxxxxxxvmwpcx\nTo solve for the first scope, we can very quickly create an embedded contract with a set of pass through functions, for each admin interface.\nFor example, an embedded governance contract that has a CreateSpork, ActivateSpork, bridge/liq methods, which creates proposals for voting and that calls the relevant downstream functions if the proposal passes.\nThe main design question here would be what are the specific parameters for voting? E.g. time period, quorum, majority vs super-majority. Do different methods have different voting params?\nSome possible concerns/limitations:\nIt gets into a slightly different topic of inactive pillars, but what happens if proposal can never reach quorum?\nWhat if there’s an urgent bugfix where the time period doesn’t make sense?\nHere, some sort of admin could make sense, likely the existing spork address to start.\nAs alluded to by scope 2, a possible downside to this simple approach is that every new embedded contract requiring admin functionality requires an extension of the governance contract interface.\nA generic approach could be having the governance embedded expose one method “SendTx” which takes in the arguments of destination and downstream data. Maybe also fields to attach ZTS to the transaction.\nHowever, this would make it more challenging to have different voting parameters for different types of transactions.\nThe most sophisticated and scalable option imho, is a templating system. It could expose two functions: ProposeTemplate, SendTemplate\nThe propose template method would take in a data structure defining a tx template, which fields are variable, and voting parameters. It’s like another layer of ABI.\nThe template would then undergo a vote for acceptance by the pillars. This voting threshold is defined by the governance contract.\nIf accepted, the template is stored on-chain/in the local db and given an ID.\nThe send template function would take in a template id and the parameters to render the template. It would then undergo a vote for acceptance by the pillars. This voting threshold is defined by the template.\nA system like this likely would not need to be adjusted as new governance capabilities became available.\nIn terms of the the third scope, I have some ideas on how to migrate hardcoded constants to be on-chain data. But I want to first develop the first two scopes and get a sense of how much harder a sophisticated but scalable system would be over the simple option.",

I hadn’t considered that. I was mostly thinking about a single downstream function call since this can allow for a very generic interface. But it’s very likely that some changes only make sense when done together.\nIn terms of where to store the variable. As in which address’s database.\nIt’s probably easiest in the governance contract itself. Part of me thinks it makes more sense to store it with the relevant embedded contracts that will be using the variable, but then every embedded contract needs an UpdateVariable method callable by an admin (the governance) address.\n\n\n\n sol:\n\n\ncreating a spork and activating it two weeks later\nNote: realistically, we may want two separate votes for spork creation and activation.\n\n\n\nOne thing I had considered was being able to define some sort of “workflow” or different state machines for different processes. But this seems like we would have to tailor it for every single process. (or define the state machine as on-chain data) That’s one reason why I liked the idea of voting on generic transaction sending.\n\n\n\n sol:\n\nOnly predefined functions in the governance contract can be executed.\n\n\nThis is what my templating idea is meant to address.\nA two tiered system.

To ensure this, I am sure to be just echoing our intent to:\n\n\nMaintain a comprehensive log of all changes enacted through the governance contract.\nMake these logs easily accessible to all members of our community, enabling any member to review past decisions and understand the rationale behind them.\n\n\n\nOn-chain is public, so just like with AZ you’ll be able to see who votes for what.\nIn terms of rationale and , not sure that data belongs on chain. Feeless doesn’t mean that blockspace doesn’t have value.\nOf course we are certainly finding ways to be able to put it on chain. I’m just saying from the perspective of process, not sure putting rationale on chain should be part of it.\nSo regarding transparency, I guess it would mostly be around the transparency for off-chain governance processes. Open Planning and Design processes (this thread) hopefully addresses what you’re asking for.\n\n\n\n coinselor:\n\n\nDelay Period: We should consider implementing a delay period between when a proposal is accepted and when the changes are implemented. I think this should be different than the time until the activation height. The benefits of this delay would include:\n\n\n\nSo I imagine, unless it’s for a critical bug, we’ll want to have a minimum voting durations. In my templating system, this could be defined as a parameter. At least when it comes to sporks, especially if it’s under pillar governance, I equate Spork creation to acceptance, and activation obviously as activation.\nThe spork creation/activation process is needed to allow clients to modify the binary to activate using the spork id. For something like changing a variable, where clients already know how to use the value, a create / activation process is not strictly needed. But agree that changes should provide time for the community to digest.\n\n\n\n coinselor:\n\nI’ll let the on-chain experts decide if this is worth it in terms of chain/binary bloat. Makes me wonder, is there even a thing as minifying the go contract like what they do with js for websites?\n\n\nFor stuff like variables in code, the compiler’s job is to put it into efficient machine language.\nFor on-chain data, you’re starting to get into things like gRPC and leveldb compression. Sol and I touched upon it during htlc work I think, but not something we need to worry about right now.\n\n\n\n coinselor:\n\nI think that rather than focusing on the specific actions or functions, it might be beneficial to take a step back and define the theoretical objectives of our governance module.\n\n\nThis process should definitely include both the WHY and the HOW.\nAs mentioned in a previous post, when it comes to governance, we have a lot of historical ideas and concerns we can draw from. We’ll have to apply them to our context, but human behavior is pretty consistent across contexts.",

Do different methods have different voting params?\n\n\nLet’s outline some of the obvious functions and discuss the different requirements.\n\nActivate Spork (acceptance implies spork creation)\nUpdate variable – some may be more critical than others\nThere are many admin functions for the Bridge and Liquidity contracts, I won’t list them all here yet\n\nBridge: Set Token Pair\nBridge: Unhalt\nBridge: Set Allow Keygen\nLiquidity: Set Additional Rewards\nLiquidity: Set Is Halted\nLiquidity: Set Token Tuple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n georgezgeorgez:\n\nIt gets into a slightly different topic of inactive pillars, but what happens if proposal can never reach quorum?\n\n\nDisaster scenario: half the pillars are unable to access the global internet.\nShould we limit quorum to those that signed momentums in the last x period?\n\n\n\n georgezgeorgez:\n\nWhat if there’s an urgent bugfix where the time period doesn’t make sense?\nHere, some sort of admin could make sense, likely the existing spork address to start.\n\n\nCould we eventually create a multisig address that acts as an admin?\nWe could adopt the guardians concept, but network-wide. A group of individuals that would respond quickly to an urgent situation.\nAn emergency poll is created and if a low threshold of non-guardian pillars vote in favor, it will temporarily give executive power to the multisig, which could require half or more of the guardians to sign transactions.\n\n\n\n georgezgeorgez:\n\nThe propose template method would take in a data structure defining a tx template, which fields are variable, and voting parameters. It’s like another layer of ABI.\n\n\nI was trying to describe this but I don’t have enough experience with go-zenon to articulate the right suggestion.\n\n\n\n georgezgeorgez:\n\nFor simple passthrough voting, the governance contract likely does not even need to interpret the data at all. It will just store the bytes and use it when it makes then downstream tx. It can be interpreted client side for UI purposes.\n\n\nI don’t understand how this is possible. Are there any examples in go-zenon or would this be new functionality?\n\n\n\n georgezgeorgez:\n\nSo maybe getting a simple pass through of spork methods, with hardcoded voting params, deployed as quickly as possible should be the first iteration.\n\n\nI would prefer the template solution but I understand if we want to solve the immediate problem with haste.\n\n\n\n coinselor:\n\nMake these logs easily accessible to all members of our community, enabling any member to review past decisions and understand the rationale behind them.\n\n\nI envision a similar process to AZ submissions.\nTitle, brief description, link to external discussion topic, along with the function calls/data changes payload.\n\n\n\n georgezgeorgez:\n\nIn terms of where to store the variable. As in which address’s database.\nIt’s probably easiest in the governance contract itself.\n\n\nYeah, I’m not sure which way is best. Are there any really good reasons for either storage method?\nAs for the Syrius UI, it might be better to delay that conversation a little bit.\nI propose that we flesh out most of the gov contract details/functionality first, then try to design UI/UX. We wasted a ton of cycles when we worked on HTLC because the contract changed a few times.",

After this, they can use Syrius to conduct a trustless swap with no fees directly with each other.\n\n### Example\n\nAlice is the starting party for the swap and she wants to swap 100 ZNN for 1,000 QSR. Bob is the joining party and has agreed to be Alice's counterparty for the swap. Bob has provided Alice with his NoM address.\n\n1. Alice starts a P2P swap in Syrius and deposits 100 ZNN for Bob. She then sends her deposit's ID to Bob via a messaging service (e.g. Telegram).\n2. Bob uses the deposit ID to get the swap's details in Syrius and he can see that Alice has deposited 100 ZNN for him.\n3. Bob joins the swap by depositing 1,000 QSR for Alice.\n4. Alice sees that Bob has deposited the QSR and proceeds to complete the swap. Once Alice completes the swap, she receives 1,000 QSR.\n5. Bob's Syrius sees that Alice has completed the swap and Syrius automatically proceeds to unlock the 100 ZNN For Bob.\n6. The swap has now been successfuly completed.\n\n\n\n\n\n  This file has been truncated. [show original](https://github.com/hypercore-one/syrius/blob/0.1.0/docs/p2p_swaps.md)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

People get their news from Twitter, use the Phantom wallet, and check Discord for validator info. I feel zenon.network is on point with its straightforward design, giving a quick overview and then pointing to where the real action is.\nSo, why not keep it simple? Let’s create a clear landing page for each specific purpose, and link to it from our main site. I kinda like the idea of a less polished look. It feels fresh, like there is “opportunity” for speculators, it reminds me when I first visited the Bitland site.\nPromoting Zenon’s mission isn’t just about our main landing page. It’s a multidisciplinary team effort – communication hubs, dev info/tooling, community memes, and everything in between.\nLastly, addressing George’s mention: I’m proficient with HTML, reasonably skilled in CSS, and can tackle JavaScript or any task with ChatGPT’s help. While I haven’t built websites from scratch, I’ve worked on several over the years, can setup a local dev environment with ease, etc.",

I’m sure it’s the problem for ZNN price action and lack of engagement from new devs. Not the lack of dev documentation, funnelling, ux and greater utility into the outbound.\nDon’t forget that in its current shape, zenon.network still doesn’t have any tech embedded to prove the value it drives for growth of the network, nor does it sound like a performance approach is what interests you. But hey because it’s hosted in the official repo and open source is what truly matters here. Not engineering systems to prove its eventual growth contribution to the network ",

        "username": "vilkris",
        "text": "The P2P Swap feature in Syrius offers users an easy and censorship resistant way of exchanging value, peer-to-peer, without intermediaries on Network of Momentum.\nThis funding request is meant to cover the development costs related to the Syrius P2P Swap feature and the additional tooling and services related to it.\n[](#impact-1)Impact\nBeing able to trustlessly exchange value between individuals in a censorship resistant way over the internet without intermediaries and other third parties is one of the cornerstones on which the cryptocurrency revolution is being built upon. Currently there is no user friendly way to trustlessly trade on Network of Momentum.\nP2P Swaps are not a replacement for an AMM or an orderbook based DEX for example, but the P2P Swap feature will offer a way for all users to conduct feeless OTC swaps with ZTS tokens, allowing for more economic activity to start taking place on Network of Momentum. The need for trustless ways of trading was once again highlighted by the recent unfortunate demise of the only CEX that ZNN and QSR were trading on.\nThe Zenon community has always had an active OTC market and large OTC trades are conducted regularly. A safe and liquid OTC market is especially useful when conducting large trades. Traditionally the downside of OTC trading is that the trading parties have to either trust each other or use a third party escrow that usually requires a fee to conduct the trade. With P2P Swaps in Syrius, there is no need to trust the trading partner or pay an escrow for their services.\n[](#team-2)Team\n[HyperCore One](https://github.com/hypercore-one), with two members as the primary contributors ([@vilkris](/u/vilkris), [@sol](/u/sol)), and three other members supporting with testing, reviews and user guidance.\n[](#breakdown-of-work-items-3)Breakdown of work items\nA breakdown of what this proposal covers:\n\n\nUI/UX design, research and iteration => 160 hours\n\n\nPrototyping, implementation and testing => 440 hours\n\n\nWriting manual test cases and doing a write-up of the implementation => 40 hours\n\n\nIncentivized peer review and testing => 30 hours\n\n\nHTLC Watchtower: design, implementation and testing => 120 hours\n\n\nFixing potential bugs post release\n\n\nA tutorial in written format\n\n\n[](#areas-of-interest-not-in-the-scope-of-this-proposal-4)Areas of interest not in the scope of this proposal\nCurrently the P2P Swap feature does not have an automatic matchmaking system, which means that users have to find a trading partner themselves. A straightforward way to find a trading partner is to use OTC chat rooms for example. Automatic matchmaking/an orderbook would have to be considered in a separate proposal.\n[](#what-about-cross-chain-swaps-5)What about cross-chain swaps?\nHTLCs can be used to facilitate cross-chain swaps and initially, when the P2P Swap project was started, the idea was to integrate a user interface for cross-chain swaps into Syrius. After a decent amount of time spent on researching and designing a solution for this, we have decided not to include the cross-chain swap feature into the scope of this proposal.\nReasoning\nWe could provide a relatively user friendly interface for the NoM side of the swap, but since there are basically no wallets on other chains that support HTLC-based cross-chain swaps, it would mean that the swap would have to be done via rudimentary command line tools on the other chains. Based on our testing, doing cross-chain swaps with Bitcoin using a command line tool is hard and error prone. So, even if there was a user friendly interface for the NoM side of the swap, the purpose is defeated when the user has to use rudimentary tooling on other chains.\nAnother option would be to attempt to integrate the full cross-chain swap flow into Syrius for some chains, like Bitcoin, but this will require a significant amount of research and effort to do and will have to be considered in a separate proposal if there is enough demand for such a feature.\nWe are still actively continuing the testing of cross-chain swaps to see what is technically feasible and what makes sense from a user experience point of view.\n[](#what-has-already-been-delivered-6)What has already been delivered\nThe [first iteration](https://forum.zenon.org/t/p2p-atomic-swaps-in-syrius/1165) of the UI design was presented to the community in November 2022. After feedback from the community and prototyping of the UI, more iterations of the UI design were made until the [final version](https://forum.zenon.org/t/p2p-atomic-swaps-in-syrius/1165/47) of the UI design was presented to the community in March 2023.\nAfter iteration and prototyping, the first version of Syrius with the P2P Swap feature ready for public testing was released a while ago. Instructions on how to try out the P2P Swap feature on the HyperCore One testnet can be found [here](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/syrius-v0-1-0-release-candidate-1-ready-for-community-testing/72).\nPlease note that the P2P Swap feature is only usable on testnet for now.\n[](#what-is-still-to-come-7)What is still to come\nThe P2P Swap feature has not yet been enabled on mainnet. We are close to having a release candidate of Syrius available for public testing that has mainnet support for P2P Swaps.\nA deposit recovery feature is still pending development. This feature will allow a user to recover their deposited swap funds in the unlikely event that they completely lose access to the machine they started the swap on.\nFurther testing and code review is also needed and the tutorial has to be made.\n[](#additional-safety-measures-htlc-watchtower-8)Additional safety measures: HTLC Watchtower\nWork on a watchtower service has been started. In short, the watchtower is a service that anyone can run to improve the safety of P2P swaps. Its purpose is to watch over the swaps that are being conducted on the network to make sure that swap participants receive their funds as expected in situations where Syrius fails to do so for whatever reason. The watchtower utilizes the proxy unlocking feature of the embedded HTLC contract.\nA more detailed write-up of the watchtower can be found [here](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/htlc-watchtower/50).\nHyperCore One is already running an MVP version of the watchtower on both testnet and on mainnet. Hopefully, in the future more watchtowers will be launched by the community to further improve swap safety.\n[](#timeline-9)Timeline\nIf nothing unexpected happens, fully featured releases of Syrius and the HTLC watchtower should be available in Q3.\n[](#funding-request-10)Funding request\nTotal: 13,000 ZNN + 130,000 QSR\nTotal hours put in/allocated: 790h\nIf this proposal is accepted, a payout request will be made for the UI/UX design, research and iteration phase and for 1/4th of the Prototyping, implementation and testing phase.\nThis means a payout request of approximately 35% of the total requested funds, which will be rounded to 4,300 ZNN + 43,000 QSR.\nIf this proposal is accepted, work on the remaining items will be continued. The rest of the funds will be requested in batches, according to the following milestones:\n\n\n1,700 ZNN + 17,000 QSR once a test version of the P2P swap feature that can be used on mainnet is available for public testing.\n\n\n2,000 ZNN + 20,000 QSR once the swap recovery feature has been implemented and is available for public testing, the manual test cases have been written and the tutorial has been made.\n\n\n5,000 ZNN + 50,000 QSR once the fully featured Syrius release and the HTLC watchtower are available and the work items have been completed.\n\n\nWe will wait for a couple of days to respond to feedback and gauge the general sentiment and amount of support for this proposal, until deciding whether to submit it on chain.",

Will the community still accept the proposal even if this is the case, I don’t know. The “official” zenon entity has been hyping up bitcoin atomic swaps, so I think there is a certain expectation in the community that they will be usable to the average user.

I’m confident that if cli tooling is needed to do the swaps, no one will do them.  And if cli is needed on the btc side (which I understand) I do not think we should spend time putting the ZNN side in SYRIUS.\nIt is so easy to make a mistake in the cli, might as well use the cli for everything.  We might be better off making a guided set of instructions on the cli to do atomic swaps rather than doing anything in syrius.\nIf I had to select between BTC in syrius with a the need for a cli (on the BTC side) and an upgraded wallet extension that does not need to be used in developer mode, I would would select an upgraded wallet extension.",

We can potentially use P2TR but there hasn’t been a ton of development yet.\nOn the bright side: we could be first movers in this space.\n\n\nWith a pruned node (txindex=0), users cannot getrawtransaction data with bitcoin-cli.\nThis means they cannot read/query any transaction outside their own UTXO set.\n\n\nThe only reason to want a Bitcoin full node, as an atomic swap service provider, is to read the transaction hex for user transactions – they can confirm tx details without a third-party explorer\n\n\nThe only reason to want a Bitcoin pruned node, as an atomic swap service provider, is to allow users to broadcast transactions via our RPC.\n\nOtherwise, they need access to a synced Bitcoin node’s RPC and the ability to follow some relatively simple instructions in the CLI.\n\n\n\nA user needs RPC access to a Bitcoin node (pruned or full) to create the p2sh contract.\nI don’t think this is a requirement for our MVP.\n\n\nThe user creating the Bitcoin contract still needs to supply their counterparty with the contract bytes.\nExample:\n\n6382012088a820a0f89cff4db3518485dc008cdc8d32b85d4d1fa16c3b01f8500854cbc172287e8876a914c6235b1b11b1aa1a7f0a861f74f1b8e3efe2cae467042fe67764b17576a914e25757bb668d79b05a6ab3f9ad9ef914faa1ceb56888ac\n\n\n\nWe might be able to use [dartsv](https://pub.dev/packages/dartsv) to parse transaction hex (supplied manually to Syrius) and inform users if the script they are interacting with will execute as expected.\nI started a PoC but it’s not ready to share yet.\n\n\nI think all we need for a cross-chain MVP is the ability to validate the following hexcode:\n\ncontract\ncontract transaction\n\nIf Bob was initiating on the Bitcoin side, he would need to supply the following data to Alice:\n\ncontract hex\ntransaction hash\n\nInformation we can extract\n\nContract public key (example: 2N3d1ZQ2p4VWha4u3utnxjMB2T2pjwND5GU)\nLocked amount\nUnlock time\nDestination address\nPreimage\n\nHere are two tx I made on Bitcoin Testnet\nCreate tx: [ff53bb1412d6636f9abd5c48026a57a4e01b148e3b1d9dd1b7a71dea0c5b3d4e](https://testnet.bitcoinexplorer.org/tx/ff53bb1412d6636f9abd5c48026a57a4e01b148e3b1d9dd1b7a71dea0c5b3d4e)\nRedeem tx: [41a47f289eece886df6ae13ae5afc6c22cef8f68047931b4f44369f6b8232b68](https://testnet.bitcoinexplorer.org/tx/41a47f289eece886df6ae13ae5afc6c22cef8f68047931b4f44369f6b8232b68)",

I think that’s the Minimum Viable Product for cross-chain swaps, though there is room for improvement. I’ll list some items at the bottom.\nIf you wish to execute cross-chain swaps today, I’d recommend using Bitcoin Testnet.\nHere’s a [faucet](https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/).\nYou’ll want to use znn-cli (C# or Dart). Here’s [a post](https://forum.zenon.org/t/dart-sdk-cli-updates/1166) with setup instructions and commands.\nI’ll summarize what I needed for this swap.\nBob will execute this:\ndart run .\\cli_handler.dart htlc.create z1qpusrlw26lly6cfwwjcrug5nnw4mkq5rr5h000 znn 100 43200 1 76e9b77cd582518b3343c5ef712d3525e5078663d15cf82b58a6d59ff0a5d69b  -k z1qr3uww8uqh75qnsuxqajegvwaesqynfglrare2 -u wss://node.zenon.fun:35998\n\nInsert passphrase:\nCreating htlc with amount 100.00000000 tZNN\n  Can be reclaimed in 12:00:00 by z1qr3uww8uqh75qnsuxqajegvwaesqynfglrare2\n  Can be unlocked by z1qpusrlw26lly6cfwwjcrug5nnw4mkq5rr5h000 with hashlock 76e9b77cd582518b3343c5ef712d3525e5078663d15cf82b58a6d59ff0a5d69b hashtype 1\nSubmitted htlc with id c316f9394c6988f4826c6e385133266530343ed3542143f5e8c29644baaf1a6c\nDone\n\nAlice will execute this:\ndart run .\\cli_handler.dart htlc.unlock c316f9394c6988f4826c6e385133266530343ed3542143f5e8c29644baaf1a6c  48370b0c156884a8a3e5dccf08779f8be3b3deb26cf116552a3251b0bce74cfb  -k z1qpusrlw26lly6cfwwjcrug5nnw4mkq5rr5h000 -u wss://node.zenon.fun:35998\n\n\nPotential Improvements\n\nWe can setup Github Actions to build and distribute btcatomicswap binaries\n\nRemoves Go dependency\n\n\nAlternatively, we abstract the CLI options and host a webservice that allows users to craft Bitcoin transactions based on input they supply\n\nUsers are presented with a dropdown: initiate, participate (Alice initiates on NoM), redeem, audit, refund, extract secret\nThe site displays a simple form related to their selection\nThe site outputs the require Bitcoin script hex that needs to be broadcast and/or shared with their counterparty\nThey can query tx info that is sent to our nodes (or a node of their choice) to inform them of swap details\n\n\nEven better: we can incorporate btcatomicswap logic (tx crafting + parsing) in Syrius\n\nWill take some time to develop\nAllows Bob to skip the auditcontract step\n\n\nHosting a full node to reduce the amount of data that Alice has to submit to Bob\n\nAlice would only need to send the Contract paragraph and Contract transaction hash\nSyrius could pull the Contract transaction hex via RPC\n\n\nAlternatively, hosting pruned nodes to allow either participant to broadcast their transactions without waiting for their own node to sync\nBitcoin wallets in Syrius\n\nGenerate legacy addresses automatically\nFuture improvements include: [P2PKH, P2WPKH, P2TR, etc…](https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-address-types-compared/)\n\n\nVideo tutorials from each participants point of view\nMaybe some sort of signaling protocol through Nostr\n\nCould be re-used for PTLCs\n\n\n",

Don’t worry if you’re not a computer programmer; I’ll break it down step by step.\n[](#step-1-downloading-the-script-1)Step 1: Downloading the Script\n\nwget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/0x3639/eda9f69e7bb1043e88a5042206c1fa94/raw/fe90e97bd7e41707b2b03e54be13afff82dc0df0/deploy-orchestrator.sh\n\n[](#step-2-make-the-script-executable-2)Step 2: Make The Script Executable\n\nMake the script executable with the command: chmod +x deploy-orchestrator.sh\n\n[](#step-3-gathering-required-information-3)Step 3: Gathering Required Information\nBefore running the script, ensure you have the following information at hand:\n\nZNN Node Address: This is the address of your ZNN node.\nETH Node Address: The address of your Ethereum node.  Follow these instructions to [setup an ETH node](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/how-to-setup-an-eth-node-for-the-orchestrator/84).\nProducer KeyFile Passphrase: A passphrase for the Producer KeyFile. Ensure you keep this passphrase safe and confidential.\n\n[](#step-4-run-the-script-4)Step 4: Run the Script\n\nRun the script with the command: ./deploy-orchestrator.sh\nFollow the on-screen prompts to complete the deployment.\n\n[](#what-does-the-script-do-5)What Does the Script Do?\nThe script is designed to deploy the Orchestrator, a service that manages various tasks. Here’s a simplified breakdown of its functions:\n\nCheck for Required Programs: The script checks if certain programs (like gcc, go, and jq) are installed on your computer. If not, it installs them for you.\nCollect Information: It will ask you for specific details like your ZNN node address, ETH node address, and a passphrase. These details are essential for the Orchestrator’s configuration.\nDownload and Install Orchestrator: The script will download the Orchestrator from its GitHub repository, compile it, and install it on your system.\nConfiguration: It modifies configuration files to ensure the Orchestrator runs with the correct settings.\nService Creation: The script sets up the Orchestrator as a system service, ensuring it starts automatically and runs in the background.\n",

If you’re on a system with curl installed (such as Linux or macOS), you can use the following command:\n\ncurl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/0x3639/979e2b0d2b0acea31dfd30849a524d4a/raw/033043a02103602cf7bfa47e9abfb79286c767c2/deploy-go-zenon.sh\n\nThis command will download the file and save it with the name deploy-go-zenon.sh in your current directory.\n\nGive Execution Permissions: Before you can run the script, you’ll need to give it executable permissions. To do this, run:\n\nchmod +x deploy-go-zenon.sh\n\n\nRun the Script: Now, you can run the script using the following command:\n\nsudo ./deploy-go-zenon.sh\n\n\nOptional: Examine the Script First: Before running any script, especially one from the internet, it’s good practice to inspect its contents to ensure there’s nothing malicious or unintentional that might harm your system.You can view the contents of the file using a text editor or with commands like cat:\n\ncat deploy-go-zenon.sh\n\nRead through the script to ensure you understand its operations and feel comfortable with its actions.\nAnd that’s it! These steps should allow you to download and execute the script from your command line.",

        "text": "All node and pillar operators should upgrade to go-zenon v0.0.7.  The chain recently forked due to a bug caused by an [edge case](https://github.com/zenon-network/go-zenon/pull/26#issuecomment-1674697126) associated with a sort function.\nIn order to upgrade follow these instructions:\nsudo ./znn-controller\nSelect #1 to deploy.  This will upgrade go-zenon to version 0.0.7.  After you upgrade run the controller again.\nsudo ./znn-controller\nThis time select #5 to resync.  If you are running a pillar on this node make sure to KEEP the existing producer file.  DO NOT replace the producer file.   if you want to speed up the sync you can run a cron job every 60 minutes to restart go-zenon.\nNote: If you are 100% confident you are on the main chain, you do NOT need to resync.  You can check this by comparing a recent hash in your log files with the hash in explorer.zenon.info.  If the block and hash match, you do NOT need to resync.  You can see recent blocks and hashes in your node by running this command:\njournalctl -u go-zenon -n 30 -f\n\nHere are the steps to restart go-zenon every 60 minutes.  Remove this insertion after syncing.\ncrontab -e\n\nthen add this line\n0 * * * * /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/service go-zenon restart\n\nA quick breakdown of the cron job:\n\n0 * * * *: This specifies the schedule. The 0 indicates the job runs when the minute is 0 (i.e., the top of the hour). The * symbols indicate that the job runs every hour, day, month, and day of the week.\n/usr/bin/sudo: This command allows permitted users to execute a command as the superuser or another user. Since restarting a service typically requires root privileges, we use sudo.\n/usr/sbin/service go-zenon restart: This is the command that restarts the go-zenon service.\n\nNote:\n\nEnsure that the user whose crontab you are editing has permissions in the /etc/sudoers file to restart the service without a password. If not, you’d need to configure sudo accordingly, which may present security risks.\nPaths like /usr/bin/sudo and /usr/sbin/service might differ based on your operating system and configuration. It’s good practice to ensure the paths are correct for your system (you can use which sudo or which service to get the correct paths).\n",

Few if any will participate\nFor me, setting up an entity in a foreign land will be a mistake.  I don’t do any international business and have no idea how to setup the entities, how to tax and report them.  I would need to hire an atty to advise me and that is a waste of money.  Then I need to hire a tax professional who does international returns.  More wasted time and money.\nIt’s possible I setup a foreign entity and lose protection b/ I’m operating out of the US.\nThe only option for me is to setup a WY LLC.  I would prefer to do it solo so it’s a disregarded entity that does not file a tax return.\n\nI’m going to setup this entity regardless of what others do.  I would encourage other US citizens to setup a WY entity so they can also participate. It costs $150/y and you can keep your identity private but known to a registered agent.\nThe setup can be complete in a few days.  That’s where I’m at.\nI think other international community members in crypto friendly jurisdictions should also create LLCs.",

As soon as the apps are verified and we have a mobile wallet, I will literally use a ZTS on mobile Syrius in my IRL movement and coaching practice, and it will be the perfect app for it.\nOn one hand, crypto is extremely complex, but on the other hand, it solves the most fundamental problems created in the digital era, such as provenance, security, and immutability.\nI enjoy having conversations with non-crypto people about these things. They ask the best questions, because they aren’t investors looking for profit. In fact, they are exactly the opposite.\nSee: I’m in it for the technology and spirituality.\nEdit: I reorganized a little bit an put different ideas into their own posts.

In order to achieve these ideals, smaller incremental steps will be required from both sides of the bridge between the crypto meta and the conventional world.\nAs for crypto, I have two flavorful NFT ideas and both of them call to be executed.\nOne is the Legacy motif which will be designed to bring together the OG community for an active and ongoing NFT project that carries community oriented utilities. First is first. I’m hoping that the conversation with Sol in the forum topic of Design Samples will lead to Zenscriptions. That will be the best possible scenario for that collection, given the design motif, historical context, OG community etc. Also good for the cult.\nFrom there I will move on with an Alphanet collection which would consist of the species avatars and the levels up through Alien. The collections will continue on with Phase 0, Phase 1, and so on and create a commemorative collection that also evolves with what NoM is capable of supporting, in terms of token standards, etc. This route would keep all of the Zenon core collections on NoM, rather than btc ordinals as I had original conceived.\nIn terms of IRL, I teach, coach, help people experience themselves in alignment with their truth. I help them see their way out of the matrix and realize that the world is abundant and consisting of much more open space and potential, than we are generally taught. I share language reprogramming, integrated body-mind movement, neuromotor re-education, talk therapy, and more.\nMy method is highly effective but where I must improve, is in the area of providing goals, achievements, milestones, etc. I used to be a martial arts teacher and I got jaded with a lot of it, which was necessary to transcend the state of the art. But I went overboard on getting rid of the belts and decorum. Simultaneously, I went overboard on Zenon, in a good way.\nNow that immutable blockchain exists, I want to put my clients’ achievements on chain. The most simple implementation is to award one ZTS token per class. This way, their record is on chain.\nThis incredibly simple use case demonstrates what a paradigm shift Zenon is, with the feature of no transaction fees, a downloadable wallet from the app store, and [insert list of features]. Of course, there will be a cost incurred to create the assets.\nNFTs would be ideal for commemorating a person’s first session, 50th session, their first pullup, etc\nImagine the dopamine hit of receiving a fat achievement box that includes an NFT card, 100 (MEZ from the MEZ dispenser), and 20 tickets to add to your stack that you can accrue and redeem for physical items like at the carnival. My programs can also be accessible to people anywhere in the world. I have a subscription to a proprietary service for memberships, videos, etc. I need to build it out.\nNow, before Zenon, how would I accomplish this use case of a mobile portfolio, so eloquently, securely, and using nonproprietary software? They will have Syrius Mobile wallet with one address that contains their Art of XXXXXXX portfolio. When they check-out of class, I can transfer the tokens to them, and by way “Congratulations, you’re student of day. Here’s your NFT!”\n\nZenon community NFTs, crypto education, cultism.\nIRL PoW rewards using Syrius mobile.\nI am also still in transition out of the martial business that provided my sons and I with our living income. So, I’m following my passions in both realms and keeping my energy open to what shall avail. Right now, it is a vast expanse to straddle while supporting my family. Everything will work out. I’m staying in my integrity and keeping my senses open while I navigate with diligence through this gray area of my USD life.\n\nI’m grateful for the opportunity share in this space. Putting these thoughts out to be seen by such brilliance, is incredibly powerful and the quantum effects are well appreciated, here.",

A user/client can fetch the json metadata at that URL, followed by another fetch to see the image.\nAs the distributor of your collection, you’ll need to authenticate tokens for potential buyers. This can be achieved with a web form that you maintain. You could potentially publish this list on NoM afterwards, as a sort of immutable stamp of authenticity.\nFor the foreseeable future, you will have to host the data outside of NoM, unless you can fit each token’s data in 16 KB after its been base-64 encoded.\nOr you can develop a Stamp or Inscription protocol with a client that can create/index/transfer/parse data stored on-chain, but it’s a lot of work.\nIf you want to do this, by all means.

BTC Machines has a collection called BTC Frens which is comprised of derivative arts as they pertain to other Ordinal projects. (The marketplaces and wallets upscale the gifs, pixel perfect.)\nI followed a very good contact of mine into the small Cheesus community (there were two active devs doing something very interesting and new re ordinals) and found a very good creative vibe. This small Cheesus project has been rewarding in its own right, and it has also proven to be a little bit of a rabbit hole full of coincidences that established and strengthened friendships.\nGetting this project into the Machines community may prove to open up more possibilities, such as a Zenon/BTC Machines Frens collection. I need to create and finalize 3-4 more pieces to complete the collection of seven, 1/1’s.\nJust in case you aren’t familiar with the cultural references:\n\n\n\n[Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/btc-machines)\n\n\n\n[BTC Machines | Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/btc-machines)\nInscriptions 38347 to 81532 | BTC MACHINE is a BTC brand.

If you’re getting the vibe for my level of creativity and way of connecting many ideas together to create meaning, then you will also appreciate BTC Machines. They build, deliver, reward the community, mobilize, etc. They are a good example of the kind of basic ecosystem mechanics I gravitate toward, but I’d like to incorporate more storytelling, lore, depth to what we are building, and intrinsic meaning. I am not a holder of an OG BTC Machine, I missed that boat, but I have some other smaller Machine assets and I keep running into  the same two key Machine members in various spaces.\nI’m not simping on Machines, but I like how they conduct their project and operate in the cryptosphere. They are one node of interest on my mindmap. Anecdotally, this is some of what I have going on.\nZenon ethos is as the core of my prospectus and motivation, and I am going to spread this vibe throughout the Mezaverse.\nAt some point, I heard [@georgezgeorgez](/u/georgezgeorgez) had some contact with BTC Machines. I’m curious.",

Some of the things he talks about are relevant to our discussion here.\nDorsey: if you don’t like the architecture of the public square, change it.  He also talks about how Satoshi started bitcoin and turned it over and vanished.  And how elegant that was.  I don’t recommend listening to this unless you have 3 hours to burn in a car or plane.\nHere are my general thoughts.  I think Kaine is far more active than we know or think. Kaine’s inaction in /zenon-network is on purpose.  It must be hard for him to see code sitting there that needs to be reviewed and merged.  And yet he lets it sit there.  I do not think he is lazy or does not care.  He is doing this on purpose.  He wants the community to take over.  He wants the /zenon-network repo to go away.  He wants us to fork him out and/or take over spork production.  He wants to vanish.\nAnd once we deliver Phase 1 my bet is he is gone forever.  We all know it’s going to happen.  It’s just a question of when. So the sooner we move in this direction the better.  However, I don’t want to do anything stupid or too quickly that puts the network at risk.\nIn summary, I am for an orderly transition away from Mr. Kaine and the /zenon-network repo.  I think this must be 100% complete by the time we deliver Phase 1 but hopefully before that.  I think we can start building trust with the community by asking the community to use our repos for critical infrastructure.\nPillars are trusting the HCT repo for the Orchestrator.  HC1 can offer the znn_controller_dart software to upgrade go-zenon to v0.0.6 by fixing big int support.  I’m going out for a walk.  I’ll post more later.\n\n[\n\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzvh4AODtWc)\n\n",

The government module is a crucial part of it. The umbilical cord can be cut with this.\nAs for the repositories, I think it’s a lot simpler. If we agree today that repo X is leading, we’ll make it leading. No one is stopping us, especially if it means we can move forward faster.\nFor this we can create a new organization e.g. Zenon-Community where all crucial repos will be stored and Team organizations fork from there. Actually the same as we now only work under our own management. If Zenon-Network wants, it can always synchronize to stay up to date with the community.",

It’s a very clear message to us.  So let’s do it.\nShould we focus on HC1 and HCT repos…  Or should they roll up to a zenon-community repo?  Early on when we debated the ZIP process we tried to avoid centralizing the repos into one gate keeper.  We envisioned having many repos that the community started to trust over time.  That way one “entity” or group of devs cannot gate keep one repo.  Sounds like Bitcoin is starting to think in this direction too.  [@georgezgeorgez](/u/georgezgeorgez) found some nice articles about it at the time.\nMy preference is to release code from HC1, HCT, and maybe even some individual repos that people trust over time.  I guess the question then becomes, how do we do code review / audits?",

But like 0x says then the issue of code reviews/audits comes into play. Maybe community org could host “core” repos like go-zenon, orchestrator, syrius, etc and fork others like SDKs etc with the emphasis on the original devs to maintain the forks and submit PRs back to community org. Not sure if this is feasible just thinking aloud.",

Question to Sumamu; could the bridge be allowed to be faster with more orchestrators online?\n\n\nAs [@aliencoder](/u/aliencoder) explained:\n\n\n\n aliencoder:\n\nIn general, adding more nodes == more message complexity => more processing time required for those messages (that are zero knowledge proofs actually) => it will get slower\n\n\nThe orchestrators are actually quite fast: they’re signing most swaps in under 2 minutes.\nThe slowness of the bridge is intentional and it’s also necessary for the security of the bridge. In short, we’ve sacrificed some of the speed for the security.\nHowever, even if signing the swaps might get slower, we should strive to increase the number of bridge participants for 2 reasons:\n\nsecurity - more nodes means it’ll be less likely for a majority of nodes to collude and mishandle the funds (to put it lightly)\nredundancy - a super majority of the bridge participants (66% + 1) is required to produce a VALID signature. With the current numbers (22 participants), 15 participants must be online to sign a swap, which means the bridge will work just fine even with 7 offline participants. If we had 60 participants, we’d need 41 online (which is higher), but we could also afford 19 offline participants.\n\n[](#why-is-the-bridge-so-slow-1)Why is the bridge so slow?\nIt’s waiting ~30 minutes for confirmations, to make sure the transactions are (very) final.\nThere’s also an extra waiting time between the first redeem (this one merely registers the swap onchain) and the second redeem (this one actually releases the funds).\nThis is called a timechallenge and it’s purpose is to give the orchestrators time to check registered swaps (the first redeem) and halt the bridge in case an invalid transaction is detected, BEFORE the funds are released (second redeem)",

Those who embrace this incentive will rise to the top 30 pillars while the others could lose weight, especially as we onboard new aliens in the ecosystem.\nI’ve PoC’d* a websocket proxy in Golang that can intercept Zenon client RPC requests and selectively return data based on any criteria. Service providers can choose which RPC calls they want to allow or deny.\nWe can productize this solution to simplify the criteria selection process for less technical pillars.\nThey can reduce the rewards they share in order to offset the cost for this service.\nFor example, if a non-delegator makes a request to query their account balance in Syrius, they will see a spinning wheel. Only delegators would have unrestricted access to all RPC calls.\nPillars can get creative with their offerings.\nNon-pillars could potentially adopt this by finding other ways to receive compensation for their service.\nEventually, we could have a page like [this one](https://publicnodes.somenano.com/), displaying node capabilities, current status, etc.\n* the PoC is rough but could be worth pursuing if this team supports the idea.\n\n\ninb4 Trust. Don’t Verify.\n\nUntil we have a process to validate which nodes are acting honestly, the community will have to trust the nodes they connect to. Given pillars are incentivized to maintain a good relationship with their delegators, they will likely provide truthy data.\nWe can also work towards the goal of node validation. There are some objective sources of truth that we can leverage, minimizing the amount of trust required to use them. Eventually, we’ll solve this problem too.\n\nPS: I made this private. If the team supports the idea, I’d like to declassify this thread and gauge community sentiment.",

Nothing really complicated.\nI already mentioned in our chat that I’ve considered integrating such an interface into Zenon Tools so that I could monetize the referrals. The biggest problem with this being the potential regulatory concerns.\nOther options would be to not integrate it into Zenon Tools but to apply for AZ funding, making sure beforehand that someone is willing to host the frontend and take any legal responsibility related to it.\nOr if the referrals are monetized, it wouldn’t necessarily need AZ funding but the potential legal issues remain.\nDoes HyperCore One have any interest/capacity to further investigate this opportunity?\nHere’s a quick mock of the look and feel that we could offer:\n[bridge1920×1080 36.2 KB](//hypercore.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/original/1X/5196d64f707e02ff8d780f2b835b2d640f96f862.png)",

Not to mention, the time (and money) required to understand the regulatory restrictions…\nI’m going to throw out a few ideas:\n\n\nWrite the code with detailed instructions on how to host it, ask for AZ, let others run it and get the referral fees.  Maybe someone will host on .onion\n\n\nExplore using decentralized (anon) infra.  Not sure how to setup an anon url that cannot be “traced”. If we use this approach, maybe ask for AZ and direct all funds from the bridge back to AZ so the network benefits.  It’s essentially “run” by the network and no one individual benefits.  AZ could pay for the infra.\n\n\nCould this be the start of a set of tools that could be funded by a 3rd party (with legal expertise).  Some here have discussed working on NoM full time.  Maybe Paradigm would be interested in funding a “venture” to deploy this tool, + AMM and others that could create value independently.  I’m not the type of person who can “work” for anyone else.  But I would be willing to help put something like this together if you guys are interested.  I’ve done several venture / PE backed investments.\n\n",

        "text": "Thank you for the ideas. It’s unfortunate that the regulatory landscape is so daunting.\nOption 1 would be the most straightforward approach. The problem with the referral system is that its meant for the marketers, not the service provider.\nAssuming lots of swaps are initiated with a referral from a marketer, the marketer will get the reward, not the service provider, unless the service provider overrides the referral with their own. But then the marketers won’t direct traffic to the webapp.\nThe referral can only be monetized when the user has no referrer, but it would still probably be profitable with enough volume.\nOption 2 could also make sense but I’m not sure what the regulatory risks would be even if it’s attempted to be done fully anonymously. Maybe some community member/entity would be willing to do this and get paid via AZ for it. Having the referral fees go directly into AZ would make sense.\nOption 3 - An intersting idea but this is probably not something I’d be looking to do right now. Proper funding for legal counsel would definitely help though.\nWhoever is hosting the current bridge webapp is probably just yoloing it in terms of abiding to regulations, but these regulatory issues are something the community will have to solve sooner or later so that more services can be provided.",

So we have a website called [hyperbridge.com](http://hyperbridge.com) (or whatever). on that site we instruct users to download the containerized webapp.  It’s like a website (with the backend) that runs locally.  From there they can perform the bridge / swap.  This issue will come up with the AMM too… The issue is not going away.\nOr, maybe we allow everyone but the US to bridge / swap on hyperbridge and if you are from the US, you need to download the webapp and run it locally…\nThis would allow the bridge to be deployed in 2 phases.\n\nPhase 1 = website that US cannot access.\nPhase 2 = downloadable webapp that can be run locally\n\nJust thinking outloud.",

All RPC responses will return big.Int as a string to increase compatibility with high decimal tokens.  If you are interested in learning more, read the [ZIP:MoonBazze-0001](https://forum.zenon.org/t/zip-moonbaze-0001/1416).\n[](#step-1-2)Step 1\nThe znn-controller and the znn-cli need to be rebuilt with the new Dart SDK with big int support. Aliencoder already added big int support to the [Dart SDK and submitted a PR](https://github.com/zenon-network/znn_sdk_dart/pull/9).\n\nIdeally the Dart SDK should be merged with the official repo before 27 June 2023.\n[](#step-2-3)Step 2\nThe znn-go-sdk has been updated to support big int. During the next few days, HCT will rebuild the orchestrator with the latest znn-go-sdk (with big int support). HCT will test the the code and others can review it.  The target release date is 27 June 2023.\n[](#step-3-4)Step 3\nAfter tests are complete HCT will announce the new version of the orchestrator and ask bridge participants to upgrade both go-zenon (v0.0.6) and orchestrator (v0.0.4) at the same time.  Target announcement is 27 June 2023.  48 hours after the announcement or after 16 orchestrators upgrade the upgrade will be live.\nDO NOT UPGRADE UNTIL HCT MAKES AN OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT\n[](#step-4-5)Step 4\nUsers can upgrade to SYRIUS v0.0.7.  This new version will not be able to access old public nodes running go-zenon v0.0.5.  That means wss://secure.deeznnodez.com:35998 and   ws://public.deeznnodez.com:35998 will no longer work with SYRIUS v0.0.7.  We will leave these old nodes in place for 30 days after we announce Step 4.\nUsers who are running  SYRIUS v0.0.7 can use the internal node or the public node wss://my.hc1node.com:35998.  Preferably users will select the embedded node.\n[@aliencoder](/u/aliencoder) continues to bug fixing SYRIUS v0.0.7 and we hope Zenon_Network will accept his PR before 27 June 2023.  Community members should work to audit and test the code over the coming days.\n[](#changelog-6)Changelog\n\nUpdated orchestrator in Step 3 from v0.0.3 to v0.0.4.\nUpdated orchestrator in Step 3 from v0.0.4 to v0.0.5.\nUpdated orchestrator in Step 3 from v0.0.5 to v0.0.4.\nUpdated target upgrade date to 27 June 2023\n",

        "text": "A community member encountered a peculiar situation during the Sentinel registration process through the s y r i u s Desktop wallet.\nThe user accidentally sent 2x 50K QSR during the registration process. The Sentinel was registered but the extra 50K QSR was still in the Sentinel contract. Even after the Sentinel was revoked, the extra QSR amount was not returned.\nThe procedure below outlines how it happened and offers a solution in case other community members encounter the problem. Hopefully we can avoid the situation altogether in future s y r i u s releases.\n[](#sentinel-registration-process-1)Sentinel registration process\nThe registration process of a Sentinel consists of 4 steps, namely:\n\nPlasma check\nQSR management\nZNN management\nRegistry Sentinel\n\nThe Sentinel registration requires 5K ZNN and 50K QSR. It is not possible to send both funds in one transaction, therefore it is done in two separate transactions. First the required QSR amount is sent (step 2) and then the required ZNN amount is checked and sent (steps 3 and 4).\nThe Sentinel contract uses two methods for the registration, namely:\n\nDepositQSR\nRegister\n\nThe DepositQSR method is called in step 2 of the registration process. As the name of the method indicates, this deposits QSR. This method can be used multiple times until there is 50K QSR or more in the contract.\nThe Register method is called in step 4 of the registration process. This sends the ZNN amount. The method also checks whether the 50K QSR has been deposited in order to register the Sentinel.\nIn case more than 50K QSR is deposited into the contract, the remaining amount remains in the contract. The deconstruction of the Sentinel will not return this amount. The Sentinel contract has a separate method for this, namely:\n\nWithdrawQSR\n\nThis method returns the deposited QSR amount not allocated to a Sentinel.\n[](#double-spend-situation-2)Double spend situation\nBecause it takes a while for the DepositQSR transaction to be processed by the network, he process may be restarted during processing.  When this happens the registration checks whether the required QSR amount has been deposited and since the transaction has not yet been processed, the registration process will ask to deposit 50K QSR again.\n[](#solution-3)Solution\nIt is not yet possible to call the WithdrawQSR method in s y r i u s v0.0.5. This is currently only possible via the CLI (Command Line Interface). The procedure below describes how it works.\n[](#zenon-cli-for-net-4)Zenon CLI for .NET\nStep 1 - Download the latest version from the [Zenon CLI for .NET repository](https://github.com/KingGorrin/znn_cli_csharp/releases).\nStep 2 - Extract the contents of the downloaded archive to a directory.\nStep 3 - Open up a [Command Prompt](https://superuser.com/questions/728810/how-do-you-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-7-with-a-shortcut-key/1218563) and navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.\nStep 4 - Execute the following command\nznn-cli sentinel.withdrawQsr -k WalletAddress -u wss://secure.deeZNNodez.com:35998\n\nReplace WalletAddress with you Zenon address.\n\nStep 5 - Open s y r i u s after executing the command to see if any QSR was returned.",

The service is either unresponsive (takes longer than 5 seconds to respond) or is out of sync, about every 30 minutes.  It’s more unresponsive than out of sync.\nI’m starting to think this memory issues is critical to solve.  The orchestrators rely on it.  When memory usage approached 70% on a 16g node, the results get worse.\nAfter I finish up trying to stabilize the public node, I’ll try pprof.",

Here is the code that I iteratively produced.  It took me about 25 revisions.  Each revision I added and tested the code.\nThis code is designed to respond to a healthcheck query on the endpoint :8080/healthcheck  It returns an HTTP status along with json message to the browser.  Then it logs error messages and keeps track of the status with a simple txt file.  Then it sends a notification to Telegram of status change in a threaded process so as to not slow down the healthcheck response to the load balancer.\nI did this in python because I’m most familiar with it.

Targeting people who can take on the big risk/reward.\nOne way of outreach I’ve thought about doing is using AZ to donate to developers for their work if our/zenon infra stack depends on it.

        "text": "I suppose the next question that would make sense to address is:\nWhy such a large ask?\nOur holistic end-to-end delivery model means that we will work with the community to create larger milestones where the value can be experienced or shown through data.\nBut this model also incurs a significant amount of overhead.\nWhile this overhead greatly enables us to deliver the value that the community needs in a fast and iterative manner, it doesn’t always make sense for these things to have their own AZ proposals.\nSome current examples:\n\n\nWe intend to maintain production quality binary builds. This carries security, integration, and testing burdens. We’ve started offering public testnets and related infrastructure such as faucets and explorers.\n\n\nThe go-zenon codebase includes various hardcoded IDs such as spork ids and the new bridge and administrator addresses that don’t work well with testnets. So we created a backwards compatible patch that would allow these values to be configured. Over time, we will productionalize this solution. A lot of other tooling such as controllers will need to be made compatible with testnets.\n\n\nTaking a holistic approach also means being aware of other work happening in the community. Oftentimes this means testing and validating the work of others in a systematic way. It means road-mapping and maintaining dynamic plans for future work.\n\n\nAs the ecosystem grows, this overhead will grow alongside it. In order to justify maintaining this overhead, we need a significant commitment from the community, so that we can recoup these costs over time as we deliver incremental value. This commitment will enable the five HyperCore.One team members to focus on end user value instead of worrying about if all the incidental costs will be covered.\nIn the next few days, we will begin working with the community to create a milestone/payout framework that the team and the pillars will both find agreeable.\nAs mentioned in our previous posts, all HyperCore.One participation is opt-in.\nThere are also some items of work that team members have delivered or are wrapping up that will fall outside of the new milestone/payout framework.",

A couple of questions:-\ni) This is a very big ask and a very specific amount- how did you come to decide upon this 150k ZNN, 1.5m QSR no.? What does it come with- how many months/years of commitment can we expect from your team? Is this a full-time commitment to the Network? Is the plan to give each of the developers on your team their own pillar(s?) to run (not against this- in fact I quite like the idea of developers running pillars and taking an active part in network governance)?\nii) Would it be possible to get an introduction to the team (though I’m sure we should be able to hangman most of them) or for the team  members to introduce themselves?  What are their specific skillsets that they are bringing to the forefront? I do not doubt our community developers but since y’all are applying for a considerable grant- I’d like to know what all we’re potentially paying for.\niii) Finally, if the “ecosystem grows” the values of the rewards that you will reap from your pillars, sentinels, or from delegating, staking or LP’ing will proportionally increase. Can we come up with a payment plan that potentially takes account of this? Perhaps your team can requests payments of this large grant in batches/instalments? This way if the price value of ZNN/QSR increases the amount requested can be reduced. This can help ensure that our AZ Warchest doesn’t deplete at such an accelerated (haha) rate.",

        "text": "Before you get started with setting up the [Orchestrator](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/how-to-setup-orchestrator/61), Pillar Operators need to setup an Ethereum Node.  There are two options to do that.  Operators can either sign up for a 3rd party node as a service or run the node locally.  After setting up the Ethereum node, the Operator needs a websocket (ws) to connect to.  Make note of the websocket endpoint.  It is needed for the Orchestrator config.json file setup.\n[](#node-as-a-services-1)NODE AS A SERVICES\nHere is a list of some of the most popular Ethereum node providers. Each node service offers different benefits and features in addition to free or paid tiers, you should investigate which ones best suit your needs prior to making a decision.\n\n[Alchemy ](https://alchemy.com/)\n\n[Docs ](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/)\nFeatures\n\nLargest free tier with 300M compute units per month (~30M getLatestBlock requests)\nMultichain support for Polygon, Starknet, Optimism, Arbitrum\nPowering ~70% of the largest Ethereum dapps and DeFi transaction volume\nReal-time webhook alerts via Alchemy Notify\nBest-in-class support and reliability / stability\nAlchemy’s NFT API\nDashboard with Request Explorer, Mempool Watcher, and Composer\nIntegrated testnet faucet access\nActive Discord builder community with 18k users\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you select Alchemy sign up for free.

Right now, isn’t it guaranteed that 120 QSR is enough to always send transactions without PoW?\nAs a general guideline I’d attempt to automate as much as possible and minimize the UI that the user has to interact with.\n\n\n\n georgezgeorgez:\n\nDo we need to give any feedback on PoW being done?\n\n\nI think informing the user of what’s happening is important. I wonder if a time estimation could be calculated for how long it will take to send the transaction. Or if we could show the percentage of how much of the required PoW has been generated.\nWe’ll also have to consider what the UX will be for receiving transactions.",

It syncs in seconds, requires no storage, and is lightweight enough to run on mobile devices.\nThe entire size of Helios’s binary is 5.3Mb and should be easy to compile into WebAssembly. This makes it a perfect target to embed directly inside wallets and dapps.\n\nSo you can sign up for Alchemy for free.  It’s a centralized node.  Then run the Helios to convert the untrusted RPC into a trusted RPC.  Maybe I can add this to the Docker setup for orchestratorNode",

As a result, projects outside his agenda might not get activated until the spork activation is in the hands of pillars (as specified in the very first ZIP).\nPersonally, I don’t feel like Kaine’s roadmap should be funded by AZ funds unless the same standards are applied as with any other community AZ submission.\nWe should exterminate any hipocrisy or double standards around what zenon prides itself with:\n\ndecentralization\nleaderlessness\ntrustlessness\n\nJust my 2 cents as a plebeian bag holder.

A lot of time gets spent on stuff like dicking around with the bridge and trying to keep tabs on what other developments are happening. Then of course everyone has their personal goals and areas of interest.\nI think Dynamic Plasma is very high priority but at the same time I think we, HC1, could have some kind of overall vision of how we’re going to deliver end-to-end solutions that create real economic activity and solve real world problems. The zenon.network website has some kind of roadmap with random stuff - we could have something similar that could be used as a marketing tool for HC1.\nSome things on my wishlist:\n\nWe should have a normie friendly user interface for the network - this could be an extension wallet or radically simplified desktop wallet for example. I’ve said this many times before, but I’m not the biggest fan of Syrius. I understand why it is what it is, but if we’re actually looking to integrate Bitcoin interop, NFTs, ordinals, etc. into a client, I do think that it would ultimately lead to a much better outcome if it was designed from scratch based on solid user-centric principles. I fear that using Syrius as the platform greatly hinders the possibility for experimentation and flexibility that is needed to deliver novel solutions at a fast pace.\nThe bridge webapp UX should be on par with other such bridges.\n\nAlso, this is not an immediate issue but since it’s looking like AZ funds will be drained out sooner or later, we may have to consider if AZ funding is the only source of income for HC1. I’m pretty sure our team has a chance of being able to sustain ourselves even if AZ funds run out in the future.\nWith all that said, we still have to be realistic about our actual capabilities since we have limited resources and time. One option could be to ask new people to join HC1, like DigitalSloth who is clearly a capable developer and seems to be driven by reasons other than quick payouts.",

If we can do that, we will 100x the number of devs working on stuff.\nLet’s assume we believe that is some sort of BTC interoperability to offload Ordinals and/or BRC-20s.

Then build out the stuff around what interests these people but follows a high level road map.\nThe main risk here is we pick the wrong deliverable.

        "text": "This article has been in the works for a while, and we approached it by considering the questions we thought our community members would ask. Below, you’ll find a list of those questions. If you prefer a quick read, feel free to skip to the ones that catch your interest.\nWho are we?\nWe are a team of elite engineers dedicated to tackling complex software projects and delivering comprehensive solutions. We have had the privilege of working on esteemed projects of the highest caliber, such as EOS, NMC, BCC…\nHow did we discover Zenon?\nWhile seeking funding for our work on similar projects and reaching out to other cryptocurrency communities like Stacks, we stumbled upon Zenon’s Accelerator-Z funding program. Intrigued , we started diving deeper into understanding Zenon. Eventually, we decided to participate in the Hyperspace program, which specifically calls for interoperability solutions. However, we subsequently became aware that another team had already obtained all the Hyperspace funds. As a result, we are now actively seeking to secure the funds from the remaining A-Z treasury.\nWhat attracted us to Zenon?\nZenon provides us with the opportunity to build upon a promising network while being rewarded for our contributions. (In truth, it appears that Zenon Pillars has made unwise decisions, and our team strongly believes that we can effectively persuade them to release the A-Z funds, regardless of the amount.)\nWhy are we building on Zenon?\nHaving worked on similar coins before ( EOS, NMC, BCC ), we strongly believe that Zenon possesses significant growth potential in the VERY long term.\nWhat are we building on Zenon?\nWe’re developing a comprehensive cross-chain solution that will facilitate the transfer of assets between Zenon and BCH ( Bitcoin-Cash ).\nWhat will the Interstellar Technology accomplish?\nOur innovative technology will enable seamless integration between Bitcoin-Cash and Zenon, allowing for native access to Bitcoin-Cash on the Zenon network and vice versa. Consider the realization of your long-awaited dream: a robust and efficient Bitcoin-Cash interoperability solution.\nHow are we building it?\nNaturally, we’re coding it. However, prior to that, extensive research is being conducted, with much more yet to be done. We’ve also assigned various members of our team to the following tasks: researching existing interoperability solutions, understanding their limitations and flaws, familiarizing ourselves with the go-zenon codebase, and actively engaging with the community (we acknowledge room for improvement in this aspect).\nWhat is the anticipated cost of implementing this technology?\nThe implementation of this technology is not expected to incur significant costs. We have carefully planned and strategized our approach to ensure an efficient and cost-effective solution. Rest assured that we are committed to providing a solution that offers excellent value without imposing a substantial financial burden. We will regularly share updates on our progress and milestones as we advance with the Accelerator projects. These updates will also include the necessary follow-up on R&D costs. Stay tuned for our ongoing communication and transparency regarding the project’s development and associated research and development expenses.\nWe appreciate your dedication in reading this post, which indicates your involvement in the ecosystem and your interest in its growth. We cordially invite you to stay updated on our progress and extend your support to our endeavors. Your engagement and support are invaluable to us as we work towards the advancement of the ecosystem.",

My guess is you submitted this way with limited support to draw out people, start a conversation, and see what happens.\nI’m afraid this will get approved without people understanding what is actually happening and could have unintended consequences.\nDo you mind if I post something publicly regarding the AZ?   I will vote no, not because I don’t support you, but because I think you are making the point that we need more rigorous standards.  Not even you. me, sol, V or C should be able to ask for this much AZ without a clear plan / path.\nThe bridge situation is not good.  And we approved a lot of ZNN.  We need to do better and this could be an opportunity for me (us) to highlight this.\nAre you OK with that?",

Should I add anything else to that list?\n[@sumamu](/u/sumamu) you implemented libp2p for the orchestrator.  Do you plan to implement that for go-zenon?\nFrom what I can tell, “IBD with zk proofs” is useful for mobile devices and dapps.  very fast download and proof of the blockchain.  I’ve run and tested [helios](https://github.com/a16z/helios) for an ETH node.  [@aliencoder](/u/aliencoder) pointed it out to me.  Maybe this tech can be used as the basis of our implementation.\n\nHelios is a fully trustless, efficient, and portable Ethereum light client written in Rust.\nHelios converts an untrusted centralized RPC endpoint into a safe unmanipulable local RPC for its users. It syncs in seconds, requires no storage, and is lightweight enough to run on mobile devices.\nThe entire size of Helios’s binary is 5.3Mb and should be easy to compile into WebAssembly.

I decided to start writing a simple “watchtower” service that does this and I’ve been testing it out on the HyperCore testnet.\n[](#for-the-non-technical-reader-whats-the-point-of-this-1)For the non-technical reader: what’s the point of this?\nWhen joining a P2P swap in Syrius, Syrius will automatically scan for the swap’s secret (also known as the preimage) and complete the swap automatically. The caveat is that for this to work Syrius has to be running after the preimage has been published but before the swap expires.\nThere are many reasons that could cause Syrius to not be able to automatically complete the swap, such as:\n\nSyrius auto locks itself → the unlock transaction can’t be sent because the keystore is locked.\nThe user doesn’t realize Syrius has to be running.\nA power outage or hardware failure.\nSyrius loses its connection to a node.\nA bug in Syrius.\n\nIf the user is not vigilant during the swap, making sure Syrius is running as expected, the user can lose access to the funds that were deposited to them and will be left empty handed.\nFortunately, NoM’s embedded HTLC contract supports unlocking HTLCs by proxy and the watchtower service can utilize this feature.\n[](#the-watchtower-service-2)The watchtower service\nThe HTLC Watchtower is meant to be a service that anyone can run on a server with relative ease. The watchtower will constantly monitor the embedded HTLC contract and automatically unlock an HTLC when Syrius fails to unlock it for the user. If a watchtower is running it would significantly reduce the risk of users losing funds. Having multiple watchtowers running simultaneously would be even better.\n[](#how-it-works-3)How it works\nThe watchtower stores all the HTLCs that are created on the network into a database. When an HTLC is unlocked, it pairs the revealed preimage with all the HTLCs that match the preimage’s hashlock in the database.\nThe watchtower periodically checks the database for HTLCs that have a known preimage and will unlock an HTLC if the recipient address allows it (by default all addresses allow it).\nOnly active HTLCs are stored in the database and any expired or unlocked HTLCs are removed.\n[](#setup-requirements-4)Setup requirements\nThe watchtower is designed to be simple to run, with minimal dependencies and requirements.\nIt will automatically manage the wallet that it uses to send the unlock transactions. The first time the watchtower is run it will request Plasma to be fused to the watchtower address and continue operation once the Plasma requirement is met.\nThe watchtower can be run on a VPS and it needs a connection to a node (preferably local).\n[](#benchmarking-5)Benchmarking\nEven though the expired and unlocked HTLCs are removed from the database, an adversary could spam the HTLC contract with HTLCs that expire after a long time, filling up the database.\nSome database benchmarks with the current data model:\nDB size with 1M records → ~900 MB\nWriting 1M records to the database → ~2600 msecs\nAdding a preimage to 1M records with the matching hashlock → ~2600 msecs\n[](#code-6)Code\nThe watchtower’s code (WIP) can be found [here](https://github.com/hypercore-one/htlc-watchtower).",

        "text": "I would like to submit for a full AZ (5,000 / 50,000) for Hypercore and Community developers to be able to access payment for small coding assignments.  I would like to setup a “group” wallet where one of a few devs could release funds from the wallet.\nMy thought is the group wallet requests the funds.  Developers perform work.  They post the work completed on hypercore.one forum.  One of the wallet “owners” needs to verify the work and payment can be released.  A wallet owner cannot release funds to themselves.  We can also establish a rate that seems fair given our current price level and we can advertise it.  For example, devs will be paid X ZNN per hour.\nDevs track the time, report the work, and a wallet owner confirms the work is complete and the time seems reasonable. Any one of the wallet owners then releases the funds.\nThoughts?",

For small coding assignments, the same principles apply as for AZ proposals, only the work is much smaller and someone else is making them.\nTeams like HyperCore-One could maintain their own standard for creating and promoting small assignments for developers outside of their own team, while maintaining quality control.\nBy encouraging well defined (fixed) assignments, both parties know exactly what is expected.",

        "text": "I have a few comments on the proposal.\n\nThe way AZ works (for everyone) is a proposal is submitted with a scope or work, the Pillars review / approve that scope or work, the applicant completes the work and requests payment for the work.  We have never had an instance where an applicant completes approved work and does not get paid.  Everyone has received payment for completed work.\n\nThe one exception (I think) is when John-Z requested payment to purchase ad space.  He had true out of pocket cost.\n\n\nI think you should establish specific goals for the AZ.  For example, you will generate no less than X new posts a week on twitter with original AI art… etc.  I think you set goals for the end of the 1m period.  Be as specific as possible.\n\n\nMaybe this first AZ should be for twitter engagement and reimbursement for 1m of MJ.  Interfacing with the community to establish a consistent theme could take time.  I personally think you need to create this personality on Twitter, let it shape itself, and then figure out how it could be useful in other places.\n\n\nMost of the people in TG and Discord today know each other and are very deeply involved with the project.  We have a nice little echo chamber going.  Over time this will change and this Scribe personality could be more useful in TG and Discord.  Today, you would be talking to OGs who know a lot about the project.  But as more people come into the project, this personality could be very useful.\n\n\nYou could help me proof my zenon.info posts.  Today, the community does that because everyone knows I make a lot of typos.\n\n\nCurious what others think.",

I’m looking forward to the challenge — however, I’ll definitely need some guidance.\nThe resources I currently have aren’t necessarily what the project looks like right now (a slide deck that describes the project’s potential more than its current reality). Are there documents that describe the way Zenon functions that I could look at? I’d also be interested in having a conversation with someone — I’m comfortable speaking over voice chat, but understand if people don’t want to do that.\nMy first initiative is just to bring ‘Scribe’ back to life, and take my time learning the more technical nuances of the project.\nThank you for the space to have this conversation, and I’m looking forward to submitting a killer AZ proposal in July!\nSincerely,\nRoreford (Scribe)",

        "text": "Congratulations, you are now the proud owner of your very own [Civilized Discourse Construction Kit](https://www.discourse.org). \n[](#getting-started-1)Getting Started\nIf you haven’t already, launch the [setup wizard](/wizard) and go through the steps to configure your site. You can run the wizard as many times as you want, it’s completely safe!\n[](#admin-dashboard-2)Admin Dashboard\nExercise your admin superpowers any time via the admin dashboard at\n[/admin](/admin)\nYou can also access it via the “hamburger” ☰ menu in the upper right: Admin functions are generally marked with the wrench   icon, so look for that.\n[](#staff-3)Staff\nStaff members are official representatives of this community. There are two kinds of Staff:\n\nAdmins, who can do anything and configure anything on this site.\nModerators, who can edit all posts and users, but cannot add categories or change any site settings.\n\nTo add additional staff members:\n\nhave them sign up on the site (or [send out an invitation to join via your user page](/my/invited))\nclick the admin button  on their user page\nlook for the Grant Admin and Grant Moderator buttons there\n\n[](#social-logins-4)Social Logins\nUsers can log in with traditional local username and password accounts. You may want to add:\n\n[Google logins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-google-oauth2-login-for-discourse/15858)\n[Twitter logins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-twitter-login-for-discourse/13395)\n[Facebook logins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-facebook-login-for-discourse/13394)\n[GitHub logins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-github-login-for-discourse/13745)\n\nYou can also [set up single-sign on](https://meta.discourse.org/t/official-single-sign-on-for-discourse/13045), or even [build your own login method](https://meta.discourse.org/t/login-to-discourse-with-custom-oauth2-provider/14717).\n[](#test-your-email-5)Test Your Email\nEmail is required for new account signups and notifications. Test your email to make sure it is configured correctly!  Visit [the admin email settings](/admin/email), then enter an email address in the “email address to test” field and click send test email.\n\nYou got the test email? Great! Read that email closely, it has important email deliverability tips.\nYou didn’t get the test email? This means your users probably aren’t getting any signup or notification emails either.\nEmail deliverability can be hard. Read [Email Service Configuration](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/main/docs/INSTALL-email.md).\n\nIf you’d like to enable replying to topics via email, [see this howto](https://meta.discourse.org/t/set-up-reply-via-email-support/14003).\n[](#categories-6)Categories\nYou have three default categories:\n\n[Site Feedback](/category/site-feedback) – general discussion about the site itself. [It’s important!](https://meta.discourse.org/t/5249)\n[Lounge](/category/lounge) – a perk for users at trust level 3 and higher\n[Staff](/category/staff) – visible only to staff (admins and moderators)\n\nDon’t create too many initial categories, as you can overwhelm your audience. You can always add more categories, and easily bulk recategorize topics later. It’s better to figure out the organization as you go rather than assuming you’ll get it all right from the beginning (hint: you won’t).\nTo add a category, visit the [categories page](/categories), then click Create Category at the upper right. You can set security per-category so only certain groups of users can see topics in that category.\nEvery category has an initial “About this category” topic. This topic will be pinned to the top of the category, and the description you enter will be used in a bunch of places. Be sure to give your new category a good, clear description, so people understand what belongs there!\n[](#pinned-topics-and-banners-7)Pinned Topics and Banners\nNote that pinning topics does work a little differently in Discourse:\n\nOnce someone reads to the bottom of a pinned topic, it is automatically unpinned for them specifically. They can change this via the personal pin controls at the bottom of the topic.\nWhen staff pins a topic, they can pin it globally to all topic lists, or just within its category.\n\nIf a pin isn’t visible enough, you can also turn one single topic into a banner. The banner topic floats on top of all topics and all primary pages. Users can permanently dismiss this floating banner by clicking the × in the upper right corner.\nTo make (or remove) a pin or a banner, use the admin wrench at the top right or bottom of the topic.\n[](#new-user-sandbox-and-the-trust-system-8)New User Sandbox and the Trust System\nIf your discussion area is open to the public, new visitors will arrive that are initially strangers to the community. Discourse has a [trust system](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/) where users can, over time, earn the trust of the community and gain abilities to assist in governing their community.\nDiscourse is designed to offer safe defaults for public communities, even with no active moderation.\n\n0 (new) → 1 (basic) → 2 (member) → 3 (regular) → 4 (leader)\n\nAll new users start out in a sandbox with restrictions for everyone’s safety. Trust level 0 (new) users cannot …\n\npost more than 2 hyperlinks\npost more than 1 image\npost file attachments\nsend personal messages\nflag posts or topics\nhave actual links in the “about me” field of their profile\n@name mention more than 2 users in a post\n\nEvery action a user can take is rate limited for safety, and especially so for new users. But don’t worry, new users can [transition to trust level 1](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/) in about 10 minutes of reading.\nThese defaults are safe, but note that while in “bootstrap mode” after you set up your site, all new users will be granted trust level 1 until you reach 50 users.\n[](#building-your-community-9)Building Your Community\nBe patient; building communities is hard. Before launching, be sure to:\n\nClearly define your community’s purpose in a pinned or banner topic.\nSeed the discussion with interesting topics.\nCommit to visiting and participating regularly.\nLink your community everywhere and promote it so people can find it.\n\nThere’s more advice at [Building a Discourse Community](https://blog.discourse.org/2014/08/building-a-discourse-community/).\n[](#sending-invitations-10)Sending Invitations\nOne way to get people to visit your site is to invite them via email. You can do this via:\n\nThe Invite button at the bottom of the topic.\nThe Invite area on your profile page.\n\nThe invite area on your profile page also includes advanced Staff methods of [sending bulk invites](https://meta.discourse.org/t/sending-bulk-user-invites/16468), and [inviting users into groups](https://meta.discourse.org/t/invite-individual-users-to-a-group/15544).\n[](#maintenance-11)Maintenance\n\n\nOne CPU and 1GB of memory, with swap, is the minimum for a basic Discourse community. As your community grows you may need more memory or CPU resources.\n\n\n[Our Docker container install](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/main/docs/INSTALL.md) is the only one we officially support.

We, too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.\nThese are not hard and fast rules. They are guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a kind, friendly place for civilized public discourse.\n\n[](#improve-the-discussionimprove-2)[Improve the Discussion](#improve)\nHelp us make this a great place for discussion by always adding something positive to the discussion, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.\nOne way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.\nThe topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.\n\n[](#be-agreeable-even-when-you-disagreeagreeable-3)[Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree](#agreeable)\nYou may wish to respond by disagreeing. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:\n\nName-calling\nAd hominem attacks\nResponding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content\nKnee-jerk contradiction\n\nInstead, provide thoughtful insights that improve the conversation.\n\n[](#your-participation-countsparticipate-4)[Your Participation Counts](#participate)\nThe conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.\nDiscourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, watching, muting and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.\nLet’s leave our community better than we found it.\n\n[](#if-you-see-a-problem-flag-itflag-problems-5)[If You See a Problem, Flag It](#flag-problems)\nModerators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.\nWhen you see bad behavior, don’t reply. Replying encourages bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just flag it. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.\nIn order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.\n\n[](#always-be-civilbe-civil-6)[Always Be Civil](#be-civil)\nNothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:\n\nBe civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.\nKeep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.\nRespect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.\nRespect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.\n\nThese are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of a major news site.\nThis is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.\n\n[](#keep-it-tidykeep-tidy-7)[Keep It Tidy](#keep-tidy)\nMake the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:\n\nDon’t start a topic in the wrong category; please read the category definitions.\nDon’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.\nDon’t post no-content replies.\nDon’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.\nDon’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.\n\nRather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.\n\n[](#post-only-your-own-stuffstealing-8)[Post Only Your Own Stuff](#stealing)\nYou may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.\n\n[](#powered-by-youpower-9)[Powered by You](#power)\nThis site is operated by your [friendly local staff](/about) and you, the community.

You may crawl the forum to index it for a publicly available search engine, if you run one.\n\n\nYou may not use the forum to send e-mail to distribution lists, newsgroups, or group mail aliases.\n\n\nYou may not falsely imply that you’re affiliated with or endorsed by the company.\n\n\nYou may not hyperlink to images or other non-hypertext content on the forum on other webpages.\n\n\nYou may not remove any marks showing proprietary ownership from materials you download from the forum.\n\n\nYou may not show any part of the forum on other websites with <iframe>.\n\n\nYou may not disable, avoid, or circumvent any security or access restrictions of the forum.\n\n\nYou may not strain infrastructure of the forum with an unreasonable volume of requests, or requests designed to impose an unreasonable load on information systems underlying the forum.\n\n\nYou may not impersonate others through the forum.\n\n\nYou may not encourage or help anyone in violation of these terms.\n\n\n[Content Standards](#heading--content-standards)\n\n\nYou may not submit content to the forum that is illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful to others. This includes content that is harassing, inappropriate, abusive, or hateful conduct.\n\n\nYou may not submit content to the forum that violates the law, infringes anyone’s intellectual property rights, violates anyone’s privacy, or breaches agreements you have with others.\n\n\nYou may not submit content to the forum containing malicious computer code, such as computer viruses or spyware.\n\n\nYou may not submit content to the forum as a mere placeholder, to hold a particular address, user name, or other unique identifier.\n\n\nYou may not use the forum to disclose information that you don’t have the right to disclose, like others’ confidential or personal information.\n\n\n[Enforcement](#heading--enforcement)\nThe company may investigate and prosecute violations of these terms to the fullest legal extent. The company may notify and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting violations of the law and these terms.\nThe company reserves the right to change, redact, and delete content on the forum for any reason. If you believe someone has submitted content to the forum in violation of these terms, [contact us immediately](#heading--contact).\n[Your Account](#heading--your-account)\nYou must create and log into an account to use some features of the forum.\nTo create an account, you must provide some information about yourself. If you create an account, you agree to provide, at a minimum, a valid e-mail address, and to keep that address up-to-date. You may close your account at any time by e-mailing <contact_email>.\nYou agree to be responsible for all action taken using your account, whether authorized by you or not, until you either close your account or notify the company that your account has been compromised. You agree to notify the company immediately if you suspect your account has been compromised. You agree to select a secure password for your account, and keep it secret.\nThe company may restrict, suspend, or close your account on the forum according to its policy for handling copyright-related takedown requests, or if the company reasonably believes that you’ve broken any rule in these terms.\n[Your Content](#heading--your-content)\nNothing in these terms gives the company any ownership rights in intellectual property that you share with the forum, such as your account information, posts, or other content you submit to the forum. Nothing in these terms gives you any ownership rights in the company’s intellectual property, either.\nBetween you and the company, you remain solely responsible for content you submit to the forum. You agree not to wrongly imply that content you submit to the forum is sponsored or approved by the company. These terms do not obligate the company to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you submit, and to change it, according to these terms.\nContent you submit to the forum belongs to you, and you decide what permission to give others for it. But at a minimum, you license the company to provide content that you submit to the forum to other users of the forum. That special license allows the company to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the forum.\nWhen content you submit is removed from the forum, whether by you or by the company, the company’s special license ends when the last copy disappears from the company’s backups, caches, and other systems. Other licenses you apply to content you submit, such as [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org) licenses, may continue after your content is removed. Those licenses may give others, or the company itself, the right to share your content through the forum again.\nOthers who receive content you submit to the forum may violate the terms on which you license your content. You agree that the company will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.\n[Your Responsibility](#heading--responsibility)\nYou agree to indemnify the company from legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account on the forum. Both you and the company agree to notify the other side of any legal claims for which you might have to indemnify the company as soon as possible. If the company fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won’t have to indemnify the company for damages that you could have defended against or mitigated with prompt notice. You agree to allow the company to control investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims for which you would have to indemnify the company, and to cooperate with those efforts. The company agrees not to agree to any settlement that admits fault for you or imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.\n[Disclaimers](#heading--disclaimers)\nYou accept all risk of using the forum and content on the forum. As far as the law allows, the company and its suppliers provide the forum as is, without any warranty whatsoever.\nThe forum may hyperlink to and integrate forums and services run by others. The company does not make any warranty about services run by others, or content they may provide. Use of services run by others may be governed by other terms between you and the one running service.\n[Limits on Liability](#heading--liability)\nNeither the company nor its suppliers will be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages their personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms.\nAs far as the law allows, the total liability to you for claims of any kind that are related to the forum or content on the forum will be limited to $50.\n[Feedback](#heading--feedback)\nThe company welcomes your feedback and suggestions for the forum. See the [Contact](#heading--contact) section below for ways to get in touch with us.\nYou agree that the company will be free to act on feedback and suggestions you provide, and that the company won’t have to notify you that your feedback was used, get your permission to use it, or pay you. You agree not to submit feedback or suggestions that you believe might be confidential or proprietary, to you or others.\n[Termination](#heading--termination)\nEither you or the company may end the agreement written out in these terms at any time. When our agreement ends, your permission to use the forum also ends.\nThe following provisions survive the end of our agreement: [Your Content](#heading--your-content), [Feedback](#heading--feedback), [Your Responsibility](#heading--responsibility), [Disclaimers](#heading--disclaimers), [Limits on Liability](#heading--liability), and [General Terms](#heading--general).\n[Disputes](#heading--disputes)\ngoverning_law will govern any dispute related to these terms or your use of the forum.\nYou and the company agree to seek injunctions related to these terms only in state or federal court in city_for_disputes. Neither you nor the company will object to jurisdiction, forum, or venue in those courts.\nOther than to seek an injunction or for claims under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, you and the company will resolve any dispute by binding American Arbitration Association arbitration. Arbitration will follow the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. Arbitration will happen in city_for_disputes. You will settle any dispute as an individual, and not as part of a class action or other representative proceeding, whether as the plaintiff or a class member. No arbitrator will consolidate any dispute with any other arbitration without the company’s permission.\nAny arbitration award will include costs of the arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for witnesses. You and the company may enter arbitration awards in any court with jurisdiction.\n[General Terms](#heading--general)\nIf a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. Otherwise, that provision should be removed.\nYou may not assign your agreement with the company. The company may assign your agreement to any affiliate of the company, any other company that obtains control of the company, or any other company that buys assets of the company related to the forum. Any attempted assignment against these terms has no legal effect.\nNeither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.\nThese terms embody all the terms of agreement between you and the company about use of the forum. These terms entirely replace any other agreements about your use of the forum, written or not.\n[Contact](#heading--contact)\nYou may notify the company under these terms, and send questions to the company, at <contact_email>.\nThe company may notify you under these terms using the e-mail address you provide for your account on the forum, or by posting a message to the homepage of the forum or your account page.\n[Changes](#heading--changes)\nThe company last updated these terms on [INSERT LAST UPDATE DATE HERE], and may update these terms again. The company will post all updates to the forum. For updates that contain substantial changes, the company agrees to e-mail you, if you’ve created an account and provided a valid e-mail address. The company may also announce updates with special messages or alerts on the forum.\nOnce you get notice of an update to these terms, you must agree to the new terms in order to keep using the forum.",
